<h2>THE NEW DEMOCRACY.</h2>



<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2></div>


<p>Upon the close of the 1896 national campaign,
it was decided at an informal conference of several
of the leaders of the Democratic party, to establish
a bureau of speakers for the continuous
propaganda of Democratic principles by new and
young men, while the acknowledged leaders of
the party were busy in the Senate and House of
Representatives. In December, 1896, headquarters
were opened at St. Louis.</p>

<p>Several hundred speakers soon became attached
to this bureau, and it was decided to form
a permanent organization, that would bring together
not only the speakers but all the workers
of the party. The outcome of this has been the
organization of the National Volunteers of
Democracy, with the Speakers' Bureau and Train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>ing
School as a special department. Each
volunteer is expected to assist in forming regular
Democratic clubs, except where for special reasons
it is found advisable to organize Silver or
Populist clubs, and also to build up and
strengthen clubs now in existence.</p>

<p>Heretofore, the handbooks for Democratic
speakers and workers, have been so stuffed with
statistics and figures as to burden and confuse
the minds of their readers, consequently there is
a demand for something simpler, for something
that will give a bird's eye view of the political
situation, with suggestions as to best methods of
work and speech.</p>

<p>It is to supply such a handbook to Democratic
speakers and workers, and to outline the plans
of the Democratic Volunteers, that this little book
has been written.</p>

INTRODUCTORY.</h2></div>


<p>The New Democracy is the Old Democracy.
It is likewise the only Democracy, and in July,
1896, after years of suppression, it became the
Regular Democracy.</p>

<p>The Democracy taught by Jefferson and Jackson
is the Democracy of Bryan, Stone and the
Chicago platform. But the victory at Chicago of
true Democracy over the counterfeit that for
years fraudulently used its name was not however
a finality; it was a beginning, and what
was there accomplished nationally is yet to be
accomplished locally in many states and cities.
We have not only to push on to new and local
victories after taking the central citadel, but what
is of greater importance, must hold the positions
already taken.</p>

<p>It was said that at the Chicago Convention we
not only "raised the dead" but "cast out devils."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
We must remember, however, that there are other
devils, which in many places still possess the party
locally, and the miracle of casting them out can
only be performed by the power that comes of
unselfish patriotism.</p>

<p>It is noble to fight for a righteous cause, but it
is glorious to WIN in a righteous fight. The exposure
of Republican lies, the betrayal of their
every promise made prior to the last general election,
the perfidy back of their pre-election
threats, have made Democratic victory reasonably
certain in 1900. When the country has been
cursed four years more by the infamous gold
standard and monopoly rule, the majority of the
people will favor a radical change. WE CAN
BE DEFEATED ONLY IN ONE WAY. Let
us repeat this. There is but one possible way by
which the producing classes can be defeated at the
polls in 1900; that is by the same old trick
used by tyrants in all ages, the placing of their
own lieutenants as the leaders of the people.</p>

<p>The plutocrats fully appreciate this. They
know that the people, weary of Republican misrule,
will vote another party into power, hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
their only salvation is to guide and control.
They can do this in but one way, by having the
opposing army officered by generals of their own
choosing. It makes no difference how big the
army, if the enemy chooses its officers, it is
doomed.</p>

<p>This was the trick by which monopoly defeated
Democracy in several states during the recent
campaign. The forces of the people were hastily
organized. The recruits were strangers to one
another. By a bold move on the part of plutocracy,
backed by ample corruption funds, the willing
tools of the money power were in many
places made leaders of the very army formed to
destroy the money power. As a consequence,
we, the people, CAST the votes, while in many
places the gold standard representatives of the
Republican and Democratic parties COUNTED
them; and incidentally failed to count MANY.</p>

<p>In 1900 the people may poll any number of
votes, but, if we fail to stamp out such traitors as
David Bennett Hill, Calvin S. Brice, Wm. C.
Whitney and John G. Carlisle, who use the
Democratic name only to defeat Democratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
principles, and who claim friendship for the poor
man only to add his product to the fortunes of
the rich; unless we expel these conspirators and
hypocrites from the Democratic party, with all
their abbettors and partners in fraud, we will be
defeated in spite of our overwhelming advantage
in numbers.</p>

<p>Democracy now means the people against the
organized money power. It is simply insanity for
us to prepare for battle and select as drill masters,
men whose salaries are paid by the very money
power against which we fight.</p>

<p>Suppose a million American soldier boys were
to march with flying flags and beating drums,
against an invading army of Cossacks and Turks,
and that by some trick the wily Czar and Sultan
should secure the appointment of Russian and
Turkish officers over our troops. Should we be
surprised if thousands of our brave boys were led
headlong into ditches and slaughtered like rats in
a trap and our magnificent army cut in pieces
by half as many European king worshippers?</p>

<p>We should not be surprised. And no man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
who knows anything about war could have been
surprised when such fate befell the magnificent
army of raw recruits led last year by Bryan
against the invasion of the European moneyed
despots. We were cut to pieces, ambushed,
scattered and defeated solely by the treachery of
subordinate leaders whom our great champion
and the people trusted, who, by sympathies,
self-interest and custom, were bound to the very
money power that we were fighting to overthrow.
And now the very men who sold out the people,
who defeated the cause of American independence
and fastened upon our nation the rule of the
European money power for four more years&mdash;these
same men, led by that adept in low cunning,
that master of political knavery and arch enemy of
popular rights, David Bennett Hill, are trying to
get a foothold again in the party they have just
defeated, are again trying to gain the confidence
of the millions whose liberties they sold, and
whose children they are now trying to betray into
perpetual slavery.</p>

<p>Some may say that it is impossible for these
conspirators ever again to get a hold on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the Democratic party. Such over-confidence is
always a fatal weakness in war. When we
know that the only possible way for plutocracy to
continue to rule our country is by corrupting the
Democratic party and placing its own agents in
Democracy's counsels, and that the united money
power of the world, will during the next four
years (aided by the best talent that can be bought
by unlimited funds), attempt to man Democracy's
army with plutocracy's hirelings. Our business
is not to lull ourselves into a false belief of security,
but to work by day and watch by night to
defeat the enemy. It is not for us to proudly
boast that there is no danger, for there is danger,
GRAVE DANGER, SOLEMN AND AWFUL
DANGER, THAT WITH AN UNLIMITED
USE OF MONEY AND THE PURCHASE
OF THE BEST POLITICAL GENIUS AND
CUNNING OF OUR COUNTRY BY MONOPOLY,
WE MAY AGAIN BE BETRAYED
ON THE EVE OF BATTLE.</p>

<p>When the outcome of our struggle is a world
to be gained or lost, civilization to go forward or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
be derailed, all that is dear to us, all that is most
sacred in life saved to us or snatched from us, we
cannot be too alert, too eager, or too anxious; cannot
prepare or organize too thoroughly for the
primaries that are to decide the leadership and
control of Democracy in the contest of 1900. We
should, each of us, swear in the name of God and
man, that all the power and influence we possess
shall be earnestly exerted from now until 1900
in ridding our party of these parasites who are in
it only to destroy it. We should bitterly oppose
the selection of any man for election judge, precinct
captain, ward committeeman, city committeeman,
county committeeman, state committeeman,
national committeeman, or any other
place of trust in our party, who is known to be in
sympathy with, or friendly to, the gold standard,
or to any one of the giant trusts now helping destroy
our Republic.</p>

<p>If we would destroy the trusts, we must be led
only by known enemies of the trusts. If we
would be victorious in this conflict against plutocracy,
we must follow only leaders whose records<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
prove clearly that they are absolutely free from
entangling alliances with plutocracy.</p>

<p>Some say we must harmonize all elements.
We cannot harmonize the interests of the man
who steals and the man who is stolen from,
any more than we can harmonize fire and water.
We only weaken our cause by trying to get the
men against whom we are fighting to join us.</p>

<p>Some one exclaims we must have the gold
Democrats with us, or we are lost. THERE
CAN BE NO SUCH THING AS A GOLD
DEMOCRAT. The Democratic party stands
for the abolition of the gold standard and every
other monopoly by means of which scheming
monopolies rob the public. A gold Democrat
is as much an impossibility as a round
square, white lamp-black or a red-hot icicle.
The plutocrats who left the Democratic party
and enlisted under the banner of Mark Hanna,
will never join us except for the purpose of defeating
our plans. They will never work for the
success of the Democratic banner, unless they
themselves carry that banner, and lead us, its
followers, into their own traps, wherein we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
shall be despoiled. For the vote of every traitor
and deserter, gained by such cowardly attempts
at compromise, we shall lose a hundred loyal
votes through sheer despair.</p>

<p>We do not need the gold bugs. If they are
honest in their professed change of heart, they
will vote for honest, fearless candidates as well as
for those of the milk and water brand, or who
have no definite programme except their secret
pledges to moneyed constituents. If they have
not experienced a change of heart, we do not want
them, for it is better that they remain open enemies
than that they become professed friends,
seeking an opportunity again to betray us.</p>

<p>We do not object to receiving in the ranks the
man who comes back to the Democratic party
and says: "I deserted you, but I wish now to return
to the fold; I was a traitor during the last
campaign, but I am willing to vote with you hereafter."
But the manhood, the self-respect, the enthusiasm
of Democracy do object and register a
vigorous protest to permitting these deserters to
assume places of responsibility with power to sell
the people out again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
No one objects to the gold-bugs returning
to our fold any more than we should to the blind
regaining their sight or to sinners desiring to
wash away their sins, but we do object to these
sinners returning at the price of giving our party
organization over into their hands.</p>


<h3>A PERTINENT ILLUSTRATION.</h3>

<p>An ominous example of the methods being
used to capture Democracy by the money power
was afforded by the lawless militarism brought
into play by the gold bugs at the recent municipal
Democratic convention of St. Louis, when, their
fraud being discovered, and legitimately defeated
by the people at the primaries and at the convention,
they appealed to the last resort of despotism
everywhere, the force of arms.</p>

<p>For many years a clique of unscrupulous politicians
controlled St. Louis Democratic conventions.
Early in the April campaign, Mr. Hugh
Brady, for many years Chairman of the Democratic
City Central Committee, stated in an interview
published in the St. Louis papers that a
clique of "machine" politicians had "fixed the
machine" to nominate Mr. Edwin Harrison for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Mayor. The street railway managers, who last
fall knifed Bryan and the Chicago platform, came
to the front as Mr. Harrison's supporters. Mr. C.
C. Maffitt, who bolted the party last fall, headed
his delegation, and in several other wards the
Harrison delegations were led by gold boltocrats.
The "machine" was for Harrison, and Hugh
Brady declared the "machine" could nominate
any man it wanted.</p>

<p>The men who supported Mr. Lee Meriwether
for Mayor were all aggressive Bryan Democrats
and opposed not only the gold standard, but also
opposed street car domination in city affairs.
They appealed from the "machine" to the people.
They pointed out how the leading supporters of
the "machine" candidate were gold boltocrats
and street railway managers, who use their political
influence to escape paying hundreds of thousands
of dollars of taxes legally due the City
Treasury. They insisted that franchises to monopolize
the public's streets ought to be sold, not
given away, to private corporations. And on this
platform they secured enough delegates to control
the convention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
On the morning following the primary election,
even the Republic, the organ of the "machine,"
admitted that Mr. Harrison had but 134
delegates, while the opposition had 153<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>When the delegates opposed to Mr. Harrison
united in supporting Mr. Meriwether, it was apparent
that nothing short of fraud and force could
prevent the defeat of the machine. Accordingly,
Mr. Ed Devoy, Chairman of the Central Committee,
called the convention to order and hurriedly
announced as its governing officers Messrs.
Lutz, Barrett and Wand, the three campaign
managers of the "machine" candidate.</p>

<p>Scarcely was the announcement made when ex-Governor
Norman J. Colman rose and protested
against the attempt to muzzle the convention, and
nominated for chairman Mr. Sterling P. Bond.
Upon Devoy's refusing to put this motion, one of
the delegates, R. T. Brownrigg, made the motion
which was duly seconded, and Gov. Colman
put the question to the convention and it was
carried by a majority of the delegates. In a sim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>ilar
way secretaries and sergeants-at-arms were
elected, the convention refusing to accept the
slate prepared by the machine.</p>

<p>After the committees had been appointed and
reported, nominations for Mayor were made, and
on the second ballot Lee Meriwether received 155
votes, eleven more than a majority of all the
delegates elected, and he was accordingly declared
the nominee of the Democratic party.</p>

<p>Thereupon ensued a scene more worthy of Russia
than of the American Republic. Foiled in
the attempt to carry the primaries; foiled again
in the effort to force their own tools upon the
convention as governing officers, the gold men
and the street railway managers who were present
on the floor of the convention, played their
last card in the game to defeat the candidate
pledged to make them pay their taxes, and
ordered their servant, Devoy, to do by force what
he had failed to do by fraud. A Board of Police
Commissioners lent themselves to this shameful
assault upon American liberty, and ordered three
hundred armed police to drive from the hall the
delegates opposed to Mr. Harrison. Sterling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
P. Bond, John J. Fitzwilliam and W. A. Brandenburger,
the duly elected chairman and secretaries
of the convention, were brutally assaulted
by the police. Mr. Bond was carted away to jail
in a patrol wagon. Mr. Meriwether, who had
been called on to address the convention after
his nomination for Mayor, was thrown from the
platform by two policemen, and, in company with
a majority of the delegates, was forcibly expelled
from the hall.</p>

<p>Since the 9th of November, 1799, when Napoleon's
grenadiers drove the French deputies
out of their convention hall at the point of the
bayonet, history affords no parallel to this outrage
by the St. Louis boltocratic politicians.</p>

<p>That in claiming a convention has no right to
elect its own presiding officers the gold boltocrats
were utterly wrong in custom as well as equity,
will be seen by recalling the manner in which
last year the Chicago Convention refused to accept
Senator Hill, the National Democratic Committee's
suggestion for chairman, and instead
elected Daniel, a silver Senator from Virginia.</p>

<p>Although the St. Louis papers subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
supported Mr. Harrison, whose nomination was
only accomplished by the illegal use of three
hundred police, those same papers did not hesitate
to say, the morning after the convention, that
the action of the machine was illegal and tyrannical:<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>


<h3>A WARNING FOR THE FUTURE.</h3>

<p>Might never makes right. The candidate
whose nomination rests not upon ballots but upon
the clubs and guns of three hundred policemen,
cannot be the rightful nominee of Democracy,
which means people's rule, not police rule. When
appeal was made from the outrage of the corrupt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
political machine, the Court of Appeals decided
that the matter was beyond its jurisdiction, that
no Court has the power to review the action of
the Election Commissioners, even though they
certify to the nomination of a candidate without
a shadow of right to such nomination.</p>

<p>Had the Court consented to examine the evidence
and gone into the merits of the case, it
could not but have decided that the rightful
nominee for Mayor was Mr. Meriwether, who
had the affidavits of a majority of the delegates
showing that they had supported him in the convention.</p>

<p>This high-handed attempt of the gold boltocrats
to tyrannize over the convention resulted
in Democracy's defeat. But despite the stinging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
rebuke administered by an outraged people, the
machine is again endeavoring to fasten itself upon
the Democratic party of St. Louis.</p>

<p>The same tactics, and even more desperate and
lawless ones, will be used by the gold plutocrats
throughout our country. The people must be
prepared to meet them.</p>

<p>What are the best methods of preparation?
It is to give some suggestions as to methods, and
to increase, the vigilance of the patriotic Democrats
and friends of humanity in whose hands it
may fall that this little volume has been written.</p>

HOW TO BEGIN WORK.</h2></div>


<p>The immediate purpose of the Democratic Volunteers
is to organize and carry on in the most
effective way the campaign for 1900. They seek
to build up and foster the Democracy of Jefferson,
Jackson, Bryan and the Chicago platform by
seeing, first, that the common people remain in
control of the Democratic party; and, second,
that the Democratic party, representing the
common people, gets control of the country in
1900. It is further hoped that the Volunteers
thus organized and trained, will become a permanent
force in the history of our Nation; a power
in the guidance of the forces behind the nation's
progress; a means of uniting the best intelligence
of our race with that faith and deep religious purpose
which permeate the common people, and of
expediting the conscious co-operation of individuals
with those giant forces that are slowly but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
surely destroying the old, and building up the new
civilization. Our plan appeals principally to young
men. Our methods are new, at least to this generation,
and as we believe that the great battle in
which we are engaged must be led by the most
vigorous, active and courageous amongst us, we
depend principally upon young men for leadership
and work.</p>

<p>Knowing that our principles are eternal, and
that in proclaiming them we have the support of
the great common people of posterity, and of
God, the Volunteers are expected to assume, upon
all occasions, an attitude of absolute confidence.</p>

<p>We are to utilize every force and every means
that perception can discover or ingenuity devise
for the forwarding of our movement. We are to
proceed, not only by usual, but by unusual methods,
taking possession of resources never before
thought of in political campaigns or religious crusades.
Our principles are to be declared both
in public and in private, and propagated methodically
and persistently in every existing institution,
organization or association of men and women.</p>

<p>The church is the center of activity for many.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
This class can be reached best by having our
truths come to them through the channel by
which they usually receive their opinion and
ideals, namely, the church. There are other
hundreds of thousands whose lives center about
the liquor saloons. To reach these our speakers
must go to the saloons. In many agricultural
communities, it is customary to hold meetings in
school houses, while in good weather, picnics,
barbecues and all day gatherings take place in the
woods. To these various customs our speakers
must adapt themselves. In some sections the
camp-meeting lasts for a week or two, in great
tents, or in special woodland resorts, permanently
constructed and kept for that purpose. Our Volunteers
will find here opportunities for effective
work.</p>

<p>But for reasons of economy, the greater part
of our work will be done outdoors. Plutocracy
can afford to hire a dozen halls where one drawing
speaker can be secured. Our movement has
a dozen speakers to every hall we can afford to
hire. We will consider first, therefore, methods
of outdoor speaking.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>


<h3>OUTDOOR MEETINGS.</h3>

<p>The easiest, the most economical, the most
fruitful of the Volunteer speaker's work, will consist
of unadvertised outdoor meetings. There
is probably not a city, village, or town in America
in which a man with a strong voice, mounting
some emergency platform and calling
out that he has something important to say,
cannot, in a short time, attract a considerable
crowd. If his message be direct, condensed, sincere
and well delivered, he can hold the crowd in
any except the most inclement weather. Coming
as a surprise does not lessen the effect, if the
words are well directed. People who could not
be induced to enter a hall to hear a lecture, people
who, if the meeting had been advertised, would
purposely remain away, will stop and listen to
an outdoor speaker; they will be interested, and
may even be converted if the truths are well
presented.</p>

<p>Of course, many passersby will listen only for
a few minutes and proceed on their way. An outdoor
crowd is always a changing one, but this
merely necessitates a special outdoor method of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
treatment. Indoors, an address is expected to be
continuous; one point must lead up to another;
a line of thought must be followed so as to produce
interest cumulative to the end. Outdoor
speaking, on the other hand, must be made up of
short, concise points, each complete in itself, so
that no person can listen for a single minute
without getting something to carry away with
him. Anecdotes should be freely interspersed,
but in condensed form.</p>

<p>As the audience is compelled to stand, often on
damp ground, and in chilly or excessively hot
weather, it is necessary that outdoor speaking
should never, under any circumstances, take upon
itself the qualities of a pedagogical lecture. On
the other hand, it must be made up of illustrations,
word pictures, and pungent assertion of
those fundamental truths known to be most essential.</p>


<h3>HOW TO ARRANGE SUCH MEETINGS.</h3>

<p>The speaker arrives in a strange town, having
entered afoot, by horse, or by rail. If he have
friends in the town, his work will, of course, be
less difficult, and it will be comparatively easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to procure a horse and carriage (or a wagon).</p>

<p>The vehicle secured, let him drive to the principal
street, stop at the corner selected as the
meeting-place, and, standing on the seat, let him
announce (his voice pitched high, but not strained,
dwelling for at least two seconds upon each word)
that a meeting will be held in a few minutes at
which "the people will be told how our country
can be freed from the curse of Hannaism and
monopoly" (or some similar striking expression).
Then proceeding to the next corner let
him repeat the announcement, and so over the
village, or, if it be a city, over as large a
section as he can conveniently cover. By making
a dozen or more of these announcements he
can always gather about him the nucleus of an
audience.</p>

<p>If unable to secure a vehicle he may go afoot,
carrying a chair to serve him as a speaker's platform.
As efficient work can be done in this
way as in any other.</p>

<p>In addressing the five or the fifty men, women
and boys who compose this audience, it is requisite
that he should begin in the same high key<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and the same deliberate manner and tone in
which he made his announcements, addressing
himself not to the few in front of him, but to the
listeners in front of their stores half a block away.
After speaking thus for five minutes, more or less,
and arousing the enthusiasm and interest of distant
listeners, he should suddenly turn his eyes
and attention from all who are more than fifty
feet away, and proceed in his natural tone of
voice. Very often persons standing in front of
stores and shops, lining the streets for two or
three squares, when the speaker changes and
lowers his tone and directs his remarks to his immediate
audience, will come near to hear, if possible,
the completion of some interesting point.</p>

<p>In large cities where there is much noise from
street cars and wagons, this work is more laborious,
and from start to finish the speech will require
all the energy the speaker possesses to keep
his crowd together and to increase its number.
But in smaller places, or in quieter neighborhoods
of large places, after the first announcements, outdoor
speaking can be reduced to a very moderate
exercise. The average man, after a month's prac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>tice,
can speak outdoors two or three hours a
day, divided into three or four speeches, without
any great fatigue, and keep it up the year round,
resting only upon days so rainy, stormy or bitter
cold, that men will not, for any inducement,
stand outdoors.</p>


<h3>PRE-ARRANGED APPLAUSE ONE-HALF
OF ORATORY.</h3>

<p>If friends can secure the free service of a drum
corps, a brass band, or a quartette of singers, to
help draw the people together, the speaker's work
will, of course, be greatly lessened, and much
will be done toward saving the voice and energies
otherwise necessarily expended in attracting
an audience. He will thus be enabled to concentrate
all his powers, convincing and teaching
his hearers.</p>

<p>But in the absence of drums or music, there is
nothing so helpful to the speaker in getting a
crowd and in holding it after it has congregated,
than a little skilfully pre-arranged applause. If
several men, helped by a dozen boys, take their
places around the speaker, and from the start take
off their hats and cheer lustily about every three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
sentences, not only does the noise attract attention
and draw listeners, but it impresses deeply
those who are present, so that each word of
the speaker has its effectiveness multiplied. A
few men, starting off in this way (if the speaker is
bright and forcible), will be joined by half the
audience, and, in outdoor speaking, generous applause
doubles the effect of oratory. It not only
adds weight to the speech, but it strengthens and
cheers the speaker, stimulating him to his
highest efficiency. It infuses new blood into his
veins and new breath into his lungs. It quickens
his heart beats and helps clear his voice. It at
once establishes a rapport between the talker and
the talked-to, and converts what might otherwise
be a number of isolated units into a sort of
organism, the vital principle of which is one central
enthusiasm voiced by the speaker.</p>

<p>To convince the friends of the movement of
the necessity for loud cheering from the start by
pre-arranged, conscious effort, is often quite difficult,
although it is important. Much tact and
skill are required to select a dozen young men before
the meeting, and train them in a few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
so that they will follow the cue of the man who
is to lead the applause and cheer when he gives
the word.</p>

<p>A very important point, where young boys are
concerned, is to stop their cheering when the
leader stops. Unless you have a confederate of
tact and personality there is danger that the boys,
once started yelling, will enjoy it so hugely that
they will keep it up in a disorderly way, and injure
the meeting much more than they help it.
But properly drilled, a dozen young boys are
worth almost as much as a drum corps. Under
proper leadership, they will stop instantly at the
pre-arranged signal, and enjoy the military precision.
Ten minutes training by an experienced
man will suffice to complete their education
in this regard.</p>


<h3>REPETITION NECESSARY.</h3>

<p>The outdoor campaigner should never fear
repetition. The average outdoor listener is not
averse to hearing something that he has heard before,
but is averse to anything dull, statistical or
requiring laborious mental effort. In fact, from
the standpoint of economy, three or five ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>dresses
made on the same street corner for three
or five successive days, will accomplish much
more for the cause than the same number of
addresses delivered each one in a different town
or locality. The apostle of the New Democracy,
traveling from place to place, should stop at least
two or three days in each village, even if he has
only one speech and must repeat it over with
variations each time. If he is resourceful and has
a few anecdotes and illustrations for each day, it
will pay him to stay a week in each town, as it
takes two or three days for new hearers to become
familiar with his objects, aims and attitude
of thought. The writer has often found that
more real, direct converts are made to the people's
cause on the sixth or seventh day in a town, than
during all of the previous days combined.</p>

<p>Thought is like seed. Whatever be the soil,
like all vegetable life, it must undergo three
stages, planting, developing and fruit bearing.
With the majority each stage of development requires
a season; one speaker sows, another
waters, and another gathers the ripe fruit.
But a brain adjacent to an empty stomach, idle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
arms or a bankrupt business, offers a more fertile
soil for new ideas, and there are some such minds
in every town wherein all these processes can be
carried on under the tutelage of one man; some
such persons in despair at the beginning of the
week, who can, by the close of the week, be
brought to the light, their gloom dispelled, and a
nobler civilization ever after clearly pictured before
their eyes, the object of their life's endeavor.
There are many persons who, by one series of
meetings, are actually converted from ignorant
participants in existing injustice to active workers
for the true state yet to be. The whole tenor and
ideals of their lives are transformed by knowledge
vitalized by faith.</p>

<p>When a week's meetings are contemplated in
country towns, experience suggests that the best
time to start is on Monday and that the meetings
all week should lead up to one or two grand demonstrations
on Sunday, when the largest crowd
of the week can be gotten together, and when,
by the aid of a Scripture lesson, a prayer and a
couple of patriotic songs, the enthusiasm can be
carried highest.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>


<h3>LITERATURE THE BASIS OF THE MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p>No outdoor meeting can fill its mission nor
make use of half its opportunities, without the sale
of literature, which enlarges and completes the
points touched on by the speaker. The object of
an outdoor speech is to interest, to stir the emotions
of men, dispel their lethargy and despair,
plant in them hope and faith, and prepare them
to think out, read out and study out the great National
problem. The attention of men, that is, the
real, serious concentration of their minds upon
great things, is so rare that when you once have
it the opportunity should be utilized fully.
Those who are interested by the outdoor speech
should be urged to develop that interest into
knowledge, conviction and action. This can only
be done by inducing them to read some book or
pamphlet, explaining in detail the points suggested
by you and backing up your assertions by
careful arguments. Ten pamphlets, or books,
sold at a meeting where men's hearts have been
opened and their prejudices melted by enthusiasm,
are worth more to the cause than ten thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
books and circulars distributed from door to door.
The sale of ten small ten-cent pamphlets at a
meeting is at least half the value of the meeting.
In this movement one chicken raised is worth
more than a whole brood hatched; one fighting
rooster is worth three dozen eggs. One campaigner,
armed with facts and possessing contagious
faith in our creed, necessarily becomes a
permanent, creative force in the community in
which he lives.</p>

<p>Literature is one element in the production of
such centers of power, not literature scattered
wildly, but literature placed carefully in the hands
of those who have been prepared by the personal
appeal of a sincere advocate to see and understand
the points enunciated. So bountiful has
free literature become and so ocean-like is the
flood upon political subjects, that it is difficult
to get men to open a pamphlet on political or social
subjects when distributed to them in their
normal condition. But first arouse them by a
stirring address, and they will willingly study
what otherwise they could not be induced to consider
even superficially.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Not only should the speaker try to sell as many
books and pamphlets as possible at the meetings,
but he should try to leave in every community or
section of a great city covered by him, some
worker who will get a stock of such literature and
continue its sale until another impulse is given
the movement by the visit of another Volunteer.</p>


<h3>ADVERTISED OUTDOOR MEETINGS.</h3>

<p>Very often a little coterie of enthusiasts will
think that with the aid of a few handbills they
can get a great crowd of their stupefied, over-worked
and discouraged fellow beings to give up
their other engagements and walk to some out-of-the-way
place or corner of the town to listen
to their speaker. Our friendly promoters do not
know that to the eye of the multitude the bills
suggest only an uninteresting harangue or the
visionary proclamations of a dreamer that in no
way concern them. The result is that very often
instead of a thousand greeting the speaker, all
eager for information and ready for a change of
heart, as anticipated, there are a dozen or so already
familiar with his teachings and sharing his
opinion on all important subjects and half as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
many idle curiosity seekers without influence in
the community. The speaker is discouraged and
the ardent reformers are chilled to the bone and
despairingly admit to each other that the citizens
of their particular community are more perverse
and hardened against new ideas and reforms than
the residents of any other locality under the sun.</p>

<p>If, instead of the preparation for an out-of-the-way
meeting and the laborious provision of seats
for people who never came, a few circulars announcing
the meeting and containing two or three
gems of thought had been distributed and the
speaker had mounted a wagon or box in the
center of town as heretofore suggested, the
meeting would probably have been a success.</p>

<p>Except on occasions of great excitement, when
men are drawn together by some celebrated orator,
or on holidays, when they expect, under
any circumstances, to leave their homes and work
and betake themselves with their families to the
woods and fields, it is important to hold outdoor
meetings where an audience can be gathered
largely from passersby.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE NEWSPAPER.</h3>

<p>A speaker talks to one hundred, one thousand
or more hearers, but by proper co-operation on
the part of the press his words are often carried
to tens of thousands more. Where the press is
not absolutely united for the purpose of maliciously
misrepresenting or suppressing the speaker's
words, at least half of his work consists
in the silent appeal to auditors he never sees,
those who read his words as reported in the
papers. A few suggestions may, in this connection,
be found of value.</p>

<p>First, have printed, typewritten, or copied by
hand, all the essential points of your speech,
ready to be handed to the newspaper representative.
Properly prepared manuscript, written on
one side of the paper only, will often be published
in full. It may be thrown into the waste basket.
But any paper will publish more of a man's
speech, if he has neatly prepared his manuscript
beforehand than otherwise.</p>

<p>Next, get personally acquainted with each editor,
entering into a pleasant conversation with
him and trying to make him your personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
friend. By this means a Volunteer can often use
the press of the opposite party to propagate his
views. The original purpose of a newspaper was
to give news, and very often, even in these degenerate
days, the instinct of a newspaper man
to give news, if encouraged and stimulated a
little, will become strong enough temporarily to
overcome his prejudice, and possibly overcome
his appreciation of the plate matter supplied by
Mr. Hanna's agents free of charge. He may even
give a column or a half-column, describing the
meeting of the New Democracy, quoting freely
the words of the speaker.</p>

<p>In dealing with Democratic, Populist and other
friendly papers, there is a secondary opportunity
for useful work. It is to show the editors how
they can force the plate matter and ready-print
establishments to furnish news concerning the
Democratic Volunteers to all their customers, by
simply demanding information on that subject.
Even request the editor to write a letter, telling
of the intense interest of his constituents in the
Volunteers, and urging that his ready-print matter
contain something weekly from the Volun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>teer's
National office. A sufficient number of
such letters cannot fail to have the desired effect.
Let every Volunteer aim to secure the co-operation
of a few editors, and the work is done. The
ready-print establishments that remain stubborn
should lose their patronage.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
SPEECHES AND MEETINGS.</h2></div>


<p>The Volunteers are organized, not to do the
easy things that have been done in the past and
are now being very satisfactorily done by others,
but rather to do what others have left, and are
leaving, undone. In communities where the
New Democracy is strong and the people are already
in the habit of gathering periodically and
during political campaigns nightly, it requires no
organization of Volunteers to provide men to
instruct and amuse them to their entire satisfaction.
Our work is to do what others have not
done and cannot do; to gather crowds where
others have failed; to create interest where there
is no interest; to make friends where we have no
friends, and, WHERE WE ARE ALREADY
STRONG AND DOMINANT IN A COMMUNITY,
TO TEACH OUR FRIENDS AND<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
BROTHERS TO SO SYSTEMATIZE THEIR
EFFORTS AND ENTHUSIASM AS TO BE
MOST USEFUL IN EDUCATING AND
GAINING THE SUPPORT OF LESS ADVANCED
COMMUNITIES ELSEWHERE.</p>

<p>In arranging indoor meetings, it is essential,
in order that our work may be fruitful, to get
out other than what is known as "the same old
crowd." There are a few people of both parties
in every community who are always interested
in politics, and who attend nearly all party meetings.
On such, ammunition is largely wasted.
A speaker should never be satisfied to address a
small crowd, the majority of whom are already
in accord with his principles. His object should
be to bring in new men, to get in fresh blood.
The motto of each of us should be, "I came not
to bring the righteous, but sinners, to repentance."</p>

<p>To secure the attendance of the non-political
class, it is, therefore, expedient, in addition to the
regular speeches, to provide some form of entertainment,
such as vocal and instrumental music,
a dramatic rendition, or a children's performance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
When an audience is assembled particularly to
enjoy the entertainment and incidentally from
curiosity to see and hear the strange speaker, it is
well for the speech to be built from materials
furnished by the local performers. If children
have participated, there is no happier way to begin
than by telling how enjoyable were their
songs and recitations, how thrilling the thoughts
born of their happy faces and hearts throbbing
with youthful hopes. The speaker might tell
how, looking into their bright eyes, his thoughts
turned toward the future, where he saw the obstacles
against which these children will have
to contend, the difficulties they will meet in getting
started in life, the unfair advantages over
them possessed by the children of special privilege.
By taking the children who participate as
a text and riveting the attention of the audience
upon them instead of considering the rights of
men in general, he can gain at once, not only the
attention, but the sympathy and the very hearts
of those who listen.</p>

<p>If the entertainment is a musical one, the
speaker might begin by describing the state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
mind produced by the sweet harmonies just listened
to. By recalling the difference between the
discord produced by ten men tuning their musical
instruments and the harmony resulting when
they play the same instruments together, he has
an illustration applicable in several ways: suggesting
the harmony and orderliness of the state
that we are fighting for, the economy of concert
in our political methods, and numerous other
points, which, if given in a conversational way,
will arrest the attention of even the women and
the children. Let him then proceed with simple
axiomatic truths that can be grasped by every
hearer, abundantly illustrated, and the crowd will
be induced to attend future meetings.</p>

<p>There are a thousand cues given and illustrations
suggested by a preliminary entertainment
that can be made the gateway to the sympathies,
affections and intelligence of those who listen.
Convince the audience that the questions treated
are neither abstract nor incomprehensible, but
simple and tangible, and concern their personal
welfare and the future of their families, and self-interest
will impel them to listen to specific arguments
backed by facts and figures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
The Volunteer who aspires to attract vast audiences
and transplant the hopes and thoughts that
flourish in his own mind to the fertile soil of other
minds, must first learn that the passion to instruct,
though a noble instinct, must be curbed
ruthlessly, else instead of an orator the "would-be"
will find himself a bore. The passion to impart
knowledge, like the other human passions,
when given free rein to exercise itself unrestrained,
defeats its own ends and at last destroys
itself.</p>

<p>How many old speakers we know who long
ago looked forward, as hundreds of young men
now look forward, to becoming orators, with
power to sway the multitudes, to guide and lead
them to higher things. But instead of orators
we call them fossils. Instead of attracting they
repel. They begin whenever permitted and never
stop until so commanded. They are brought out
and used in emergencies when no one else can
be obtained, but never otherwise. They are common
hacks. Why is this? Not always because
such men do not possess ability. Some of them
have followed the world's greatest thinkers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
throughout their intricate reasonings and profound
solutions of life's most serious problems.
But at the very start they conceived wrong notions
concerning the function of a public
speaker, an erroneous impression as to the utility
and object of a speech or popular address.</p>

<p>We have often noticed that superior minds
are overlooked on popular occasions and some
man with less capacity and knowledge, far less
endowed with mental treasures, is called upon
to do the honors of the occasion. Why? Because
he has the faculty of addressing himself
directly to the listeners and of adapting himself
to their frame of mind.</p>


<h3>TEN COMMANDMENTS.</h3>

<p>To those who would become speakers and
avoid the mistakes that cause the majority of failures,
the following rules will be found valuable:</p>

<p>1. Do not try to tell all you know at any one
time.</p>

<p>2. Do not try to appear deep, learned or
poetical.</p>

<p>3. Do not try to prove every statement you
make.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Use statistics sparingly.</p>

<p>5. Address yourself, not to the kind of men
and women you would have made had you been
the Creator, but to the actual men and women
who have been created, who fill your halls and
make up your audiences.</p>

<p>6. Make your talk personal and apply every
point to the wants, woes and sentiments of your
listeners.</p>

<p>7. Never regret the half hour or the hour
occupied by the music, recitations, drama, or
other entertainment preceding your speech.</p>

<p>8. Do not manifest impatience at the time
consumed in short talks by local speakers.</p>

<p>9. Remember that generally all the good that
it is possible for you to accomplish if your audience
by preliminary exercises is brought into
rapport and sympathy with you, can be accomplished
in half an hour. If you can get the complete
attention of your audience for half an hour,
they will have sufficient matter to fully occupy
their thoughts the rest of the day and night, and
not only this, if your talk is interesting and
they go away hungry instead of satiated, they will
gladly attend the next meeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
10. Be satisfied if you interest your hearers
and be not greedy to instruct. For those really
interested by oratory will instruct themselves by
means of literature which is the only source of
real instruction. Oratory should win sentiment
and stir interest; literature performs the work of
education. The speech fulfils its mission if it
persuades men to read aright.</p>


<h3>ENTERTAINMENT.</h3>

<p>A meeting that is half entertainment or if
illustrations, anecdotes and stories be included
under the head of entertainment, a meeting
that is nine-tenths entertainment and
one-tenth direct statement of fact and reasoning
therefrom, is of far more value than a
three hours' bombardment with facts, figures, arguments
and the soundest reasoning, directed by
a master. The average human mind, as God
made it and as our present unsocial life has unmade
it, will become wearied by such an effort
and leave the meeting with the firm resolve not
to attend another. Such meetings cannot be held
often and do not win the sympathies and co-operation
of men nearly so much as a meeting planned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and arranged on the basis of adaptation to the
capacities of the average listener and his multiform
emotions and mental wants. This is the
secret of the success of the popular churches.
They do not try to teach the people too much.
They do not strain that organ, very weak in the
average human mind, known as the logical
faculty.</p>

<p>Far more progress can be made in any community
by instituting a successful series of meetings,
wherein serious reasoning occupies a minor
portion of the time, the rest filled in by entertainment,
than can be gained by meetings that furnish
a perfect mine of wealth in the way of food for
thought and intellectual feasting for the few who
have the power to appreciate such things.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>


<h3>LIFE IS SHORT.</h3>

<p>The length of the man's speech should be
measured, not by his own physical endurance nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the time that his breath lasts, not by the amount
that he has to say nor even by the capacity of his
audience to listen or to remain in the room, but
in every case it should be measured by the capacity
of his hearers to enjoy.</p>

<p>Most political meetings are too long. Very
often two or three speakers are engaged, each
harboring the erroneous opinion that duty requires
him to talk an hour. Now, any speaker
who cannot say something good, useful and inspiring
in fifteen minutes, is incapable of saying
anything good, useful or inspiring at all.</p>

<p>Except in times of great excitement or in out-of-the-way
country districts where meetings are
few and the hearers, like savages in a forest, must
gorge themselves when they have a chance, the
speaking should never, on any occasion, last more
than an hour and a half.</p>

<p>Where there are three speakers, not only
should each be limited to half an hour but the
chair should be filled by a man with pluck and
personality sufficiently great to tap the speaker
on the shoulder when his time is up.</p>

<p>I have seen more hoggishness displayed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
political meetings than ever at a dinner table.
The man who sits down at a table and eats everything
in sight before his friends arrive, is a gentleman
compared with the fellow who occupies the
time of his colleagues at a public meeting; because,
if by one man's greed all the food on the
table is eaten, other food can be obtained, but
when some oratorical hog monopolizes the opportunity
of his fellow-speakers, he takes from
his colleagues what can never be replaced.</p>

<p>Our volunteers will accomplish a great work
for humanity indeed if one of their number succeeds
in inventing a method to stiffen the backbones
of presiding officers sufficiently to enable
them to sit down on that species of "bore" who
push themselves to the front, ask to speak first
by pledging to quit at a specified time and then
talk on until the audience begins to disperse.
Few people appreciate the great loss caused to a
party or movement by the vacillating weakness of
presiding officers and the greedy instincts of men
who like to be heard and, in order to satisfy this
instinct, "hog everything in sight."</p>

<p>One mission of the volunteer speaker is to teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
etiquette to the political speakers of our own
party and when "Ex-Governor So-and-So" and
"Prosecuting Attorney Other-man" and "Judge
Dry-Bones" and "Ex-Judge Old Fogy" and "The
Honorables" and "The Colonels" and "The
Generals" and the bulldozing youthful speakers
assume to occupy time not intended for them, to
take the chairman by the arm and stand by his
side until he redeems the pledge made before the
meeting and stops the mouth of the insolent fellow
who has not sense enough to regard the rights
of his fellow-workers.</p>


<h3>AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION.</h3>

<p>If a prominent man, known to be long-winded
and lacking in this one requisite of a gentleman,
is present and it is uncertain that the presiding
officer has the courage necessary to call him down
at the right time, our voluble celebrity should
be told that the position of honor being the
last on the program, it has been POSITIVELY
given to him. Thus the other speakers will
have a chance to plant a few ideas in the minds of
their auditors before they are hopelessly wearied.
Although the last speaker may injure the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
effect of the meeting by his prolonged and drawn-out
harangue, the self-assertive and independent
ones among the listeners can, at least, leave
the room when they get fatigued, without missing
the opportunity of listening to those whom they
came to hear. This point is purposely emphasized,
and strong language not inadvertently used.</p>

<p>Where more than one speaker participates,
there is nothing more essential for a successful
meeting than that each speaker be limited in time
by a pre-arranged plan, and that each be forced
by the presiding officer strictly to observe that
limit.</p>


<h3>MORE THAN TWO MILLION MEMBERS.</h3>

<p>The success of the Christian Endeavor movement
in the Protestant churches is due almost
solely to their method. The Christian Endeavor
Societies have no new message to the world; they
advocate no reforms; they do not add anything
to the teaching of the church; do not even take
it back to any of those sublime truths of the past
largely ignored and forgotten by the modern
church. But there is one simple reform in the
method of carrying on religious meetings to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
which the Christian Endeavor Societies owe their
success, and by means of which alone they have
gained more than two million members in little
more than a decade. This great and valuable
secret is their system of two or three minute
addresses, and their requiring participation in the
meeting by every member.</p>

<p>Some of us are familiar with the old time
Protestant prayer-meetings, composed of five or
six old men, from ten to thirty middle-aged and
old women, with a scattering boy or girl forced to
attend by parents. The prayers were long. The
talks were dry. The presence of a young man or
woman was always a surprise.</p>

<p>The Christian Endeavor Society with the same
theology, the same message, the same hymns, not
even having a new impulse, a new moral ideal, or
a new hope for the betterment of the world, but
merely by requiring each member to say a few
words and requiring that they say no more than
a few words, has succeeded in joining together
over two million young people into a prayer meeting
society. Young people and prayer meetings!
Always before suspicious of each other! Presto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
change! Two million young people organize in
fifteen years to attend prayer meeting. The explanation
of this miracle is ENFORCED
BREVITY.</p>

<p>Short speeches, the extinction of bores, and the
participation in each meeting in some way by
every listener are so far as method goes the essentials
for a great popular movement.</p>

<p>Good manners that have been taught to most
of the world as regards eating and drinking have
begun to be introduced into the world of meetings,
religious and political, and when we see a
feature, a little reform of this kind, building up in
a few years one of the largest and most formidable
religious organizations in the way of numbers
that the world has ever seen, the organizers and
workers of the new Democracy should profit
thereby and at least learn the lesson, "Don't bore
the people." It were better that the long-winded
talker were a Republican or that he were thrown
into the sea than that he should be allowed to destroy
our meetings by his prolonged and learned
discourses. Flee from the long-winded man, or
else turn on him and make him sit down when his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
time is up. Or do with him as you do with the
man who displays swinish proclivities when you
invite him to dinner, DON'T INVITE HIM
AGAIN.</p>


<h3>THE BUREAU OF VOLUNTEER SPEAKERS.</h3>

<p>A community feels that it needs to be awakened,
and desires to arrange a series of meetings.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
How can suitable speakers be had? So often a
mistake is made. A speaker goes off on a tangent;
he carries his hearers into a labyrinth of
statistics and details, from which he cannot extricate
them; he makes one "break" that alienates
more votes than his whole speech wins, or in
other ways proves himself incapable of accomplishing
good for the community that he visits.</p>

<p>Heretofore such a man, by bulldozing prominent
politicians into giving him letters of recom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>mendation,
might impose himself on one community
after another, and continue for years to
injure the party. By proper co-operation of the
party with the Bureau of Volunteers Speakers,
this evil, in a large measure, can be avoided, because
this Bureau does not send a man to speak
until it is thoroughly acquainted, not only with
his character, but his capacities and judgment,
and knows his method of argument and what he
is to advocate. When young and comparatively
inexperienced speakers are sent out, it is known
beforehand what is to be said, as their speeches
are prepared and rehearsed in advance. They
must know what they have to say, and not trust
to inspiration, which often results in perspiration
for the speaker, and exasperation for the hearers.</p>

<p>Every speaker sent out will present the great
fundamental truths of our movement and not
waste time in arguing details, which only supplies
our enemies with new weapons to use against us.
His speech beforehand has been pruned and criticised;
the dead branches lopped off; the twigs and
vines cleared from the trunk of the tree, and he is
prepared to do only such work as will make con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>verts
and deepen the convictions of those already
with us.</p>

<p>There exists no other Bureau or Headquarters
in America, through which Democratic organizations
can obtain at all times the best talent, and
never fail to get a man who will strengthen their
local organization.</p>

<p>Again, when meetings are held regularly in a
town and a work of systematic education is carried
on, it often happens that one speaker following
another repeats over again the same statistics,
the same arguments and even the same stories
heard before, thereby tiring the audience. But
when a community is supplied regularly by the
National Bureau, each speaker takes up a different
phase of the great problem, recapitulating
only the few fundamental truths on which our
movement rests. Each presents also something
new, bright and spicy of his own. By this arrangement
every community can enjoy the benefits
of a succession of good speakers every month
or week during the whole four years, and escape
the persecution of those unteachable bores, who
think themselves speakers. The crowds at these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
regular periodical meetings will increase, because
each time they will hear something just as good
as the last time, with added special features, the
result of individual genius.</p>

<p>At present, when a speaker is wanted, anybody
is invited who happens to be available, his abilities
being measured by his own recommendation, or
by letters bulldozed from prominent men, who,
for reasons of political prudence dared not offend
so energetic a fellow. A community in this way
may secure a good speech occasionally, but often
the speaker is a positive injury to the cause. One
poor speech in a series does more to lessen the
general interest and reduce the size of the crowds
thereafter, than can be overcome by half a dozen
good speeches.</p>

<p>Of course, where the local Democracy can secure
the services of some one of our national leaders,
no bureau mediation is needed, but our
national leaders are few and the work before us
limitless, therefore the service of the Volunteers'
Bureau in training, equipping and guaranteeing a
large number of new speakers who can be secured
at any time, by any community, at a mod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>erate
expense, is meeting with hearty response by
Democratic clubs generally.</p>

<p>The best way to make a strong club anywhere
is to institute a series of meetings, all the year
round, and, by having at least one able speaker
each time, never to disappoint the audience.</p>

<p>Let each town and village establish a lecture
course at once, and place itself in communication
with the Volunteers' Bureau. The more numerous
and closer together such villages and towns
are, the smaller will be the expense to each community
and the easier will it be to make up
regular circuits for speakers.</p>


<h3>THE CO-OPERATION OF CONSTITUENTS
NECESSARY.</h3>

<p>Although every speaker sent out is guaranteed
to do effective work, the leaders of each community
are urgently requested to report to headquarters
at once, the success or short-comings of
each speaker and meeting. Without such co-operation,
the Bureau cannot keep that oversight
of its hundreds of speakers necessary to raise the
standard of work to the highest efficiency. It
is assuredly the duty of local workers to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
straight-forward reports to headquarters, of the
short-comings and "breaks" on the part of the
representatives of our Bureau, who represent our
party and for whom our party is responsible as
well as to report the benefits resulting from each
meeting. The fact should also be emphasized that
each representative of the Bureau receives a letter
of recognition and instruction once a month from
headquarters, and his standing with the Bureau
should be judged solely by such letters or by
direct correspondence. We must be able, when
any speaker fails on his part to fulfill our requirements,
to cease our connection with, and our responsibility
for him.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
METHODS OF TRAVEL.</h2></div>


<p>For those very respectable speakers of the old
school who go to a town only when sent for and
speak only at meetings properly advertised and
pre-arranged, who are blessed with a goodly
supply of that eminently obstructive article, the
chief burden on every popular movement, commonly
called dignity, there is no advice needed
as to methods of travel. For such well regulated
exponents of bimetallism and reform about the
only advice that can be given is "be sure that your
car fare is sent to you before boarding the train."</p>

<p>But to another class of speakers, those who
make up the rank and file of Democracy's Volunteers,
those whose purpose and power of will are
such that no obstacles, no stumbling blocks, no
hardships can embitter or delay, those in whom
the fire of enthusiasm for humanity has burned
up their dignity and who in starting out do not
ask whether they have means to go respectably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and comfortably and quickly or not, but one
question presents itself, namely, "Can I get to my
destination in time to deliver my message?" The
methods used by such will be various.</p>

<p>When we have the money to buy railway tickets
and when cars go at the proper hour, we will
travel by rail. Otherwise we will drive when we
can conveniently secure a horse and vehicle, or
we will gladly mount the saddle or a wheel. But
when car tickets, carriages, saddle horses and
bicycles are alike impossible, the man fighting for
principle will rise superior to his dignity and dependence
upon small comforts and taking a
bundle of literature and a small bag will, before
starting, ask himself only, "Are my shoes good?"</p>


<h3>EXPERIENCE FAVORS TRAVELING
TWO BY TWO.</h3>

<p>The early Christian disciples went out preaching
the gospel by twos. Throughout history and
in the experience of those living, it has been
found that the will and intensity of purpose of the
average man is better preserved and that he more
easily overcomes obstacles, troubles and disappointments
if in traveling among strangers he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
companionship. Therefore although, at times
the Volunteers may travel as individuals, lonely
and homesick, still, wherever it is practicable, we
advise our speakers to travel by twos. It is much
easier to walk five, ten, twenty, or even forty miles
in a day, from one town to another with a companion.
Not only is loneliness overcome, but
two speaker and workers have more than twice
the influence upon a community that either would
exert separately. Besides it is safer, and, in case
of sickness or accident, there is some one to go
for help or to "tell the story."</p>


<h3>AFTER ENROLLING.</h3>

<p>Two young Volunteers start out for a month's
campaign in the cause of American liberty. We
have no money, the extent of our capital being a
bundle of Democratic literature, an appointment
from the Bureau of Volunteer Speakers and a
good pair of shoes each. We start at seven
o'clock in the morning from town "A." It is
twenty miles to "B" where we wish to speak at
night. We walk six miles by nine o'clock and
are then overtaken by a farm wagon in which we
are allowed to ride eight miles, when it leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
our road. We give the driver a pamphlet, thanks
and a blessing and we part. It is now eleven
o'clock and we walk six miles further when at
one o'clock we reach our destination.</p>

<p>In ten minutes we have found a friendly Democrat
who, after looking at our letters, shakes our
hands, takes us to his house and provides food.
After resting a couple of hours after dinner, we
make an outdoor talk as suggested in Chapter
three, and announce a night meeting.</p>

<p>If those who profess the name Democracy in
this village are overburdened with sham dignity
and devotion to what is old and inefficient and
refuse to recognize or aid the appointed speakers
of the people's cause, we must be ready to
rely on other resources. Our afternoon collection
may amount to ten cents or it may reach
fifty cents or a dollar. The crowd may, however,
refuse to contribute anything. We may sell literature
sufficient to supply our wants, or the gold
standard and the trusts may have caused such a
scarcity of cash that we cannot sell anything.
We may be compelled to get our supper and maybe
breakfast by trading a pamphlet to a grocer for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
crackers and cheese. After speaking in the afternoon
and evening if we should meet with no success
or recognition, expediency would suggest
that we shake the dust from the soles of our feet
and proceed on our journey toward a more
friendly community, while the oppressor prepares
the way for the work of education later.</p>

<p>In some places friends will supply car tickets;
in others they will procure a carriage or wagon
and deliver us to the next town. From other villages
or towns we may have to proceed as we
started and as the apostles used to travel, walking
along the dusty road, the frozen ground or
through mud or snow. This method of travel is
not only now practiced by many of our speakers,
but can and will become the method of thousands
more. It is a thoroughly practicable and sensible
method of teaching truth against great odds and
adds to the force of the speakers' message by
proving him sincere.</p>

<p>That this plan of campaigning is altogether
feasible the writer can personally attest from
actual experience. Years ago, as a mere boy, I
became intensely interested in the principles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the New Democracy and starting without money,
without friends or any organized assistance, impelled
merely by enthusiasm for humanity and
hatred of that tyranny through which my race
and family had suffered, I traversed in this way
every county in the State of Kansas, circulating
thousands of pamphlets in which were pointed
out the way to a nobler civilization. While still
a boy I also walked or rode with friends through
Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania
and New York. I was often interfered with by
persons disposed to disagree, but at every village
and town and city through which I passed, I
stood up in the open street in a carriage, on a dry-goods
box or a chair and proclaimed my faith
that the poor people need not suffer as they do if
they would but unite in behalf of their own interests
and use the ballot against oppression and
tyranny.</p>

<p>Very often I was without money, and I then
discovered that my early study of hygiene could
be turned to good account. I found that the
great capitalists, aided by Edward Atkinson and
the soup house reformers, in trying to devise a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
diet for the poor that might enable them to work
for less wages, though failing in this, had at least
given me a pointer. I found that their bill of fare
lacked but one ingredient to make it very endurable,
and that was enthusiasm and youthful hope
and fire. I added this ingredient and was independent
of the world.</p>


<h3>HYGIENE AS A WAR MEASURE.</h3>

<p>Those Volunteers who intend not only to try
to speak for the cause during the next four years,
but have determined to fight for the continuation
of our Republic in spite of all obstacles, should
learn how independent the body really can be of
what are usually termed the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>As an invalid child I attended a course of lectures
delivered by one Dr. O'Leary. This distinguished
gentleman, with the theatre stage,
which he used as his platform covered over with
polished skeletons, manikins, human heads in
chloroform and colored pictures of the various
parts of the human frame, impressed my young
mind deeply. At that time, I remember I had
been "given up" by my parents and the doctor,
as a child who could not possibly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
raised. I was accustomed to thoughts of death
and for years constantly expected a visit from
the dreaded monster. No memory is more distinctly
engraven on my mind than the nights
when, with eager eyes fastened on this wonderful
man and his mysterious skulls and manikins, my
heart throbbing, my face aglow, I listened in rapt
attention, that possibly I might catch some secret
that would help me defeat death and add strength
to my frail body sufficient to do battle with life's
hardships.</p>

<p>After describing a boy who died at about my
own age because his nervous system had been
deprived of the proper life-giving elements which
had been taken from his food by modern processes,
the Professor took up a handful of wheat
letting it fall repeatedly through his fingers, stating
that each grain of wheat contains in it all of
the elements required to sustain human life. He
said that civilization, by taking away the outside,
the most nutritious part of the wheat, had struck
a blow at the physical development of our race.
He declared that man can live for years on whole
wheat requiring no other article of diet, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the outside of the wheat especially, now thrown
aside as bran and fed to the cattle, contains the
elements of bone and nerve fibre, that, while
the lady who eats only the choicest white bread,
made of the finest flour, has to substitute gold for
parts of her teeth, the teeth of the cattle that eat
the bran are perfect. He gave as an illustration
the march of Caesar and his legions through Gallia,
when Caesar's soldiers often for weeks at a
time were without provisions and were compelled
to feed on whole wheat alone which they would
snatch in handfuls from the fields as they
marched, thresh in the palms of their hands and
grind with their molars. The crushing of the
hard wheat grain gave the teeth exercise while
the crushed bran and surface of the grain supplied
those elements required in the construction of
bone and teeth. "At the present time, nineteen
centuries after," so this doctor said, "there are
numerous skulls of these same soldiers of the
great Caesar to be seen in the London Museum
and as a result of their wheat mastication, every
tooth is as sound in these skulls, as whole and free
from decay as when heathen Rome was Mistress
of the World and Caesar was King."</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>


<h3>A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.</h3>

<p>Whether this astounding statement of the
learned doctor has any basis of truth or not I
do not know, but that the lesson he sought to
impress by it is true, my own experience can attest.
During a period of several years, with another
young enthusiast, I subsisted on a diet of
bread and apples except when these could not be
had, when we repaired the waste of our bodies by
eating whole wheat, a bag of which we constantly
carried with us for "emergencies." Often we
have subsisted on whole wheat and clear water
alone for several days, and even a week at a time.
During these periods we did not notice that we
lost flesh. Of course we had very little to lose,
but our vigor and the intensity of our enthusiasm
and faith in our powers, all of which depend
largely upon the amount of nutriment carried
from the stomach to the brain, and various nerve
centers, were not in the least diminished. Later
on we found that when convenient, we could obtain
more nourishment from the wheat with less
chewing by having it boiled, but when boiled,
we could not carry with us a week's rations with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>out
fatigue, and boiled wheat will become sour in
the summer time while whole dry wheat will keep
for years, and, like feminine beauty, remain ever
fresh. It is the most condensed form of digestible
food known to man.</p>

<p>Of course where men have dissipated and
their powers of digestion have been undermined
by intoxicating liquor, tobacco, or the habitual
use of highly spiced and over-prepared
foods, any coming down to a natural diet like this
is a severe hardship. But for a young man with
firm faith and good health, NOT TO BE IMPEDED
IN HIS DESIRE TO BECOME AN
ESSENTIAL FACTOR IN THE GREATEST
MOVEMENT OF HISTORY BY THE MERE
FACT THAT HE HAS NO MONEY WITH
WHICH TO PAY CAR FARE AND BUY
GOOD FOOD AND CLOTHES, the suggestions
here given will be found helpful. I would
not advise others to do, what I have not done or
am not willing to do myself. The fact is, however,
that any young man, in good health, and
formed of the right kind of "dust," can travel,
without any money from one end of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to the other speaking daily, and accomplish much
for our cause, even if he does not meet more than
one true friend in a thousand miles. But the
comforts and vices and follies of civilization he
must be able to do without.</p>

<p>This austere and ascetic mode of life is not
commended for its own sake. The suggestion is
merely thrown out as one possible way of beginning
work, so that no young man in good health
can claim that he would have done wonders for
the cause had he not been prohibited by poverty.
No such excuse exists. Healthy single men can
live and thrive if buoyed up by hope and faith
and manly purpose, and travel the world over on
a quarter of the wages of a day laborer.</p>


<h3>NOT CIVIL BUT MILITARY.</h3>

<p>To those persons who may possibly criticise
these suggestions as tending to encourage a lower
standing of living, thereby indirectly aiding
in the lowering of wages, I will simply say that I
am not giving suggestions for methods of civil
life but only military suggestions to be acted upon
in time of war. The battle is now on. No conflict
of the past ever appealed more strongly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
sublime qualities in human nature than the present
war of the people against the united plutocracy
of all countries. It is therefore appropriate and
timely to give any and all suggestions that may
be of value to those bearing the brunt of the people's
battle.</p>

<p>Can it be urged against the half starved Cuban
patriots that because they have learned how to
subsist through months on roots and berries,
and sugar cane their habits are likely to
lower the standard of living in Cuba? In answer
the smallest boy would say that the
Cubans eat berries this year in order to eat watermelons
next year, that they chew slippery elm and
sheep sorrel to-day in order to have roast beef,
oysters and plum pudding to-morrow. They are
now eating the food of the animals and sleeping
in the open fields with the beasts and dying, as
the cattle die, by order of a butcher, that their
countrymen and their children and their children's
children hereafter may live as free men,
enjoying the heritage of a free Cuba and all the
varied gifts of civilization.</p>

<p>Did our forefathers of the Revolutionary War<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
lower the standard of living and decrease wages
or injure the cause of labor or of trade-unionism,
because, in fighting for country they were willing
to go without shoes, staining with blood from
their wounded feet the projecting icy rocks that
gashed them as they marched against the British?
Oh, no! Our forefathers went without shoes that
we might have them. They went hungry and
cold and gave up their individual comforts and
lives, that we, their descendants and fellow-countrymen,
might have greater comforts, increased
liberties and life more abundant.</p>


<h3>GENERAL MARION.</h3>

<p>When General Francis Marion with his brave
soldier boys was lying in at Snows Island on the
Pedee River, North Carolina, preparing to make
another one of his surprising and brilliant raids
on the enemy, an officer from the British post at
Georgetown was dispatched to visit him to treat
for an exchange of prisoners. The blooming
Britisher was blindfolded and carried by a circuitous
route into camp. The bargain arranged, he
accepted an invitation to dine. The meal was
served on pieces of bark and consisted entirely of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
roasted potatoes of which General Marion ate
heartily, requesting his guest to profit by his
example, repeating the old adage that "Hunger
is the best sauce." "But surely, General, this cannot
be your ordinary fare" said the well fed adversary.
"Yes it is," replied Marion, "For
months at a time my men have lived on roasted
potatoes, and we are especially fortunate on this
occasion to be able to provide a double allowance
to set before so honorable a guest." The young
foreigner was so overcome with admiration for
the brave patriots fighting for their country in
such a spirit that on his return to Georgetown
he retired from the service, declaring his conviction
that men who could with such cheerfulness,
endure the privations of such a life, could never
be subdued.</p>

<p>The blooming Britisher was right. The God
of William Tell, of Cromwell, of Washington and
Marion, of Garrison and Lincoln, of Moses and
of Bryan, never has and never will permit such
enthusiasm and faith and patriotism to go unrewarded.
Men with purpose so intense, whose
flame of patriotism burns so brightly as to con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>sume
their love of comfort and dependence upon
external things, can never be subdued by hired
Hessians nor the combined forces of opulence,
ease and greed.</p>

<p>Going out in such a spirit, demanding three full
square meals each day for every human being
born into the world, yet to obtain this end willing
ourselves to live like Marion's band on roasted
potatoes, like the Cuban patriots on sugar cane
and berries, or on graham bread and apples, or
to ease our hunger if necessary by grinding with
our teeth dry whole wheat, we will in the name
of God and humanity take this country and rescue
our world from those who now make of it a living
hell.</p>

<p>This unconquerable, independent spirit that
rises above physical conditions, social limitations,
comforts and luxuries, is and always has been the
conquering spirit of the world, always the sure
omen of victory.</p>

<p>If Marion and his band could rise superior to
physical appetites in fighting for thirteen little
colonies away off from the great centers of civilization;
if the followers of Gomez and the im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>mortal
Maceo can march over perilous mountains
and through deadly marshes, suffering continually
for want of food and drink, and for years
swing with almost supernatural skill their deadly
machetes against the brutal hordes of Spain, in
order to free one little West India isle, then surely
we, who see the brutal arm of a united world
plutocracy striking down and destroying all that
has been bought so dearly by Washington,
Marion, and Lincoln, about to enslave the world's
home and refuge of freedom for a hundred years,
we should not be unwilling to make any sacrifice,
take any risks, perform any drudgery.</p>

<p>In defending our country we decide the destiny
of the human race. We fight to make
seventy millions of people free and eventually to
free the world. Ours is the most sublime, the
most terrific, the most inspiring of all historic
struggles.</p>

<p>In fighting we will take the advice and learn
what we can from any source however humble.
We will listen to the hygienist, the vegetarian,
even to the soup house reformer, if their words
will help free us from those chains of poverty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
that paralyze the arm of the ordinary slave and
make him impotent to strike back against his oppressors.</p>

<p>The man who, because he earns his bread by
labor, is looked down upon by the companions
of his youth and, because of his helplessness and
his clothes, is fenced out of respectable society,
such a man requires condensed and highly spiced
food. He craves wine and beer and whiskey and
every condiment and stimulant that can raise his
spirits, depressed by failure, disappointment
and the slow plodding life that offers no advancement.
Continual drudgery, without opportunity
for promotion, engulfs man in a gloom
uncheered by a ray of hope.</p>

<p>The reformer, the friend of labor, the idealist,
the true Christian believe that such victims
should not only have the best food and drink,
better clothes and better homes, but that they and
their children should also have a chance to rise,
should never be debarred from opportunities for
advancement or for utilizing any talent or genius
before discovered or that may hereafter be discovered,
that might lift them to a plane of distinction
and honor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
We believe in luxury; so much so that we believe
every poor man's family should have an opportunity
to enjoy all those healthful and normal
luxuries which invention and progress have
placed within the reach of men. But the greatest
of all luxuries, that which is more appetizing than
pepper or salt or cinnamon or garlic, that which
is more stimulating than beer or whiskey or even
champagne, and which must precede in the
hearts of the masses the procurement of all these
other and lesser luxuries, is that divinest gift of
Heaven&mdash;hope. Give a man all the other luxuries
that the world affords, and take away hope, and
his blood thickens, his eye becomes dull, his
color heavy and his pulse irregular. But allow
him only dry bread in the open air and sunlight
by a flowing brook, and give him hope, and his
eye flashes, his heart throbs quicken, his face
flushes, his muscles harden and all his physical
and mental powers are ready for instant application.</p>

<p>We, the Volunteers of the New Democracy,
have an abundant supply of this stimulant more
powerful than any liquor, more appetizing than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
any condiment, more soothing than any narcotic,
giving power and increased facility without reaction.
We have hope. We have faith. We have
purpose. We have absolute knowledge that our
cause is just. We know that we shall win. We
cannot be suppressed. We cannot be put down.
The world is ours. WE ARE INVINCIBLE.</p>


<h3>NO RAILWAY PASSES.</h3>

<p>In starting out to destroy plutocracy, the first
thing the average weakling does is to approach
some senatorial or congressional tool of the very
plutocracy that he thinks he is opposing, and ask
him to beg plutocracy for a weapon to fight it
with, free of charge. In other words, in opposing
the trusts and monopolies, among which the railroad
monopoly is one of the most tyrannical and
corrupt, he asks for a free railway pass.</p>

<p>The railroad pass is the most corrupting instrument
in American politics to-day. It buys
for a small price our congressmen and senators,
our county and state committees of both the Democratic
and Republican parties, our bosses in both
parties, our editors, Democratic and Republican,
our preachers, Democratic, Republican and Pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>hibition,
and many of our Democratic lecturers
and speakers. Even many of our labor leaders
make themselves impotent in this great struggle
by accepting railroad passes. Our labor statisticians,
from the National office in Washington
to the smallest State branch, aid in smothering
facts and giving life to fiction in order to ride
on railroad passes.</p>

<p>Our speakers, in accepting the gage of battle
laid down by plutocracy in the late campaign,
must neither ask nor accept favors of our enemies.
We must defy them. Rather than ride on railroad
passes we should walk.</p>

<p>We should learn from that venerable Cuban
patriot, Maximo Gomez, who, when offered a sop
by the brutal despotism against which he was
fighting, although it was presented to him by
those two eminent yet despicable toadies of
European tyranny, Messrs. Cleveland and Olney,
refused point blank to consider their degrading
propositions and answered: "We do not accept
favors of Spain. We hate Spain. Our business
is not to ask favors but to fight."</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>


<h3>DEFY THE RAILROADS.</h3>

<p>During the late campaign the railroad corporations
united not only to aid in continuing the
gold standard by the use of corporation funds
but in robbing our people of a free ballot by the
most treasonable acts of coercion and intimidation.
There is not a giant stock jobber, tax
dodger, labor skinner or other law protected
thief in the country who has stolen more than
one million dollars from widows and orphans and
other unsuspecting investors, who has not been
aided and abetted in his nefarious schemes by the
railroad corporations. There is not a single
monopoly nor trust that preys upon legitimate
trade and commerce but has been fostered in its
unnatural growth by railroad discrimination.
There has not been a single reform advocated for
the benefit of the common people during the last
thirty years, but has been fought bitterly by the
railway officials.</p>

<p>We cannot destroy plutocracy, we cannot
fight the trusts, we cannot fight the gold standard
unless we are willing to defy the railroads.</p>

<p>If, during our coming Congressional campaign,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the railroads continue their habit of monarchical
coercion and intimidation, depriving American
citizens of their right to a free ballot, we must
be sufficiently intelligent and determined to co-operate
with the enraged and long-suffering
people who will then be forced to declare for
government ownership of all public highways
thus destroying, at a single blow, this most dangerous
and tyrannical form of plutocratic despotism.</p>

<p>We cannot afford to ask for railway passes.
If we cannot pay our fare and cannot secure a
horse, WE MUST WALK.</p>


<h3>BRYAN WAGONS.</h3>

<p>Before describing our method of fitting up and
sending out Bryan wagons, something should be
said about the use of the word "Bryan," and of
Mr. Byran's request that his name should not be
used by clubs and organizations.</p>

<p>The word Bryan no longer belongs to any one
man. It has become the common property of all
who love liberty. The word Bryan became the cry
of exultation at the birth of the New Democracy.
At this most momentous historic event of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
present century when an ideal was grasped from
the upper realm of books, of hope, of morality
and religion, brought down to the world of
fact and embodied in flesh and blood; when what
before was a dream, a philosophy, an aspiration,
suddenly allied itself with physical agencies and
created a political power that surprised the world,
the one cry into which the long oppressed millions
breathed their joy, their hope, their hate, their
devotion to their fellows, their defiance of their
enemies was the magic word, Bryan! Bryan!
As this one word was repeated and cheered and
cried aloud to express both hope and anger,
promise and defiance, it became sacred. It
flitted from the possession of the single human
mite whom it had pleased God to appoint as the
herald of the new dispensation, and became the
common heritage of humanity.</p>

<p>At the Chicago Convention one citizen lost his
name, but the world found it and the word Bryan
became the battle cry of all who fight for freedom
or strive for justice.</p>

<p>As this individual citizen of Nebraska cannot
by any act or blunder in the future, efface the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
mark that he has made upon history's scroll nor
smother the fire of enthusiasm his eloquence has
lighted nor imprison again in his single
breast the wondrous truths breathed out of it that
now fill the whole world, so neither shall he
rob us of the one magic word, once his own,
NOW OURS, which, wherever uttered, kindles
lethargy and inertia into enthusiasm and fills the
abode of gloom with the light of hope.</p>

<p>The people need a key-note, a battle cry, one
single word that expresses all they believe and
feel and hope. We have such a word. It is
BRYAN. We intend to keep it and utter it
wherever and whenever it will cheer us or help
our cause. And if again one individual citizen's
modesty prompts him to interfere with our
rights, our only answer will be: "Hands off,
honored sir," or, in the immortal words of Pennoyer
of Oregon, "You tend to your business
and we, the people, will tend to ours."</p>


<h3>BEST WAY TO START.</h3>

<p>Where one or two or three persons are willing
to start on a trip from town to town, and, with
the co-operation of their friends, can secure a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
large covered wagon and two horses with a supply
of condensed food, we would commend this
as the most economical and efficient method of
campaigning as it affords not only means of
transportation, but supplies a dwelling house to
the occupants, and at the same time, by the
proper application of paint to the covered wagon,
the wagon itself and the horses may become living
missionaries, continuous and convincing
speeches in themselves, by their presence protesting
against the continuation of existing political
barbarism. If at the top of the cover is
painted in large letters, the words, "Bryan
wagon," every child, every woman in the
farthest country district, every passerby, whatever
be his race, religion or education, will know instantly
that this wagon, now passing through the
country, is one of the army of wagons being used
in the work preparatory to the decisive battle of
modern times to be fought in 1900. A few well-chosen
sentences painted on the wagon and
American flags at the top, will make it serve as
the best possible advertisement for meetings.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>


<h3>MAKE YOUR ENEMIES ADVERTISE
YOU.</h3>

<p>The moment this wagon arrives in town every
gossip, every old woman, every street gamin,
every enemy of Democracy is converted at once
into an advertising medium for the propaganda
of our cause. The wagon, the horses, the dried
beef, the apples, the whole wheat, the literature
and everything that the wagon contains become
subjects for conversation in the village. The
Bryan wagon is the center of interest and the
Volunteers who live in it are objects of curiosity.
By meeting time the people are prepared to listen
with open eyes and open mouths, drinking
in every word of the speaker's message.</p>

<p>Its work done, the wagon moves on to the next
town but the sight of it is a powerful aid to the
memory of every inhabitant of the village. Each
will recall time and time again the character of
the speakers and the words and prophecies that
they uttered, so that when the next speaker, traveling
on his shoe leather or maybe in a palace
car wearing silk hat and patent leather shoes,
arrives and tells the people how they can free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
themselves from the money power, they will remember
the wagon and the men who lived and
traveled in it and spoke from it.</p>

<p>It is well to have the wagon so constructed
that, when the time for meeting arrives, by removing
the top it can be used as a speaker's platform
and the announcements made from the front seat
as it is driven from corner to corner.</p>


<h3>FORWARD, MARCH.</h3>

<p>Let a thousand such wagons be started out at
once and kept on the road for four years visiting
every country school district every village from
Maine to New Mexico and from Texas to Oregon,
each carrying an abundant supply of literature.</p>

<p>Let every Democrat patronize the Volunteers
liberally, purchase from each a quantity of literature
for distribution and sale and throw in a
piece of silver as the hat is passed around.
When possible supply them with substantial
and well-cooked meals so that they can better
stand their heroic diet when they find no friends.</p>

<p>Start the hat agoing at once in each community,
and let the town or the county that pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>chases
a Bryan wagon put the name of such
county, town or village on the cover. Let
counties in Colorado, Arkansas and Texas fit out
such wagons and start them toward the heathen
territory of Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Maryland.</p>


<h3>ABOLISH NAKEDNESS AT HOME BEFORE
GOING ABROAD.</h3>

<p>Let the money heretofore sent by our religious
friends to teach the naked savages of foreign
islands to be ashamed of their nakedness and to
desire clothes, be applied now to the conversion
of America to the conviction that every citizen
of our own country who wants clothes should
have a chance to earn them. If America is destroyed
by that arch-devil worship, gold idolatry,
if our Republic goes down amid the horrors of
a violent revolution and military despotism, following
in the footsteps of Rome and Greece and
Egypt, what will result from our missions in foreign
lands? They will become relics of the past
because no possible teaching can then convince
the poor heathen that our religion is a saving
power. When the very country from which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
missionaries come is the helpless victim of greed,
avarice and organized crime, how are other races
to be tempted to follow our example? Let us
rather turn our missionary money for the next
four years, ALL OF IT, into the coffers of the
New Democracy, and start our wagons toward
the doubtful states from every Democratic and
Populist stronghold. Let the more civilized people
of Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska, where the
creed of progress has reached the greatest altitude
in earth's history, share their increased physical,
intellectual and moral development with the less
progressive and more barbarous states that fringe
the ocean uniting us with decaying Europe.</p>

<p>Such friendly action will not only be rewarded
by the satisfaction that always follows a righteous
act, but the givers will be blessed of God. Nothing
that a man can do, or a woman, or a child,
will accomplish more good in this world or gain
greater reward in the land of the hereafter, than
the giving of their dollars and dimes and pennies
for the starting of Bryan wagons. In this way
the western and southern centers of thought and
unselfish patriotism may uplift and educate those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
states where greed, political corruption and the infamies
of Hannaism still hold undisputed sway.</p>

<p>Let the churches of the Western states hold
entertainments, let suppers, masked balls, ice
cream socials, cider picnics and barbecues be held
by the good women of every village and the proceeds
devoted to the equipment of "Bryan
wagons." And after they are started out, each
well provisioned with literature, blankets and
food, and containing two good speakers and
workers, the good women who raised the money
to start them should continue their benign activities
and proceed at once to raise a fund to keep
on hand, so that when our missionaries send tidings
of persecution, accident or neglect, they can
be answered at once by a generous remittance.</p>

<p>In order to insure the permanency of the venture,
and that the wagon and horses may continue
to serve the cause even if the men traveling
with them desert their posts, a bill of sale or
transfer of the wagon and horses should be sent
to our National headquarters or to our state
officers on the day of departure. The friends of
the organization would then be communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
with in advance wherever the wagon went, and in
case either one or both the speakers tired or
deserted, the vacancies would be filled at once
from headquarters, and in the meantime the
horses and wagon would be cared for.</p>


<h3>OUTDOOR MUSIC.</h3>

<p>There can be no greater aid to the success of a
"Bryan wagon" than for the volunteers to carry
with them and be able to play a banjo, guitar,
violin, or small organ. Music is one of the
world's forces and as rare music, like all rare
things, is a very small part of the whole,
it is not necessary that our music be of that
sort. If we have the best arguments, we can
afford to let the other side have the best music.
But we must not, for this reason, give up music
altogether. Therefore a man who is proficient in
any musical instrument that can be played out
doors, is a valuable acquisition to a Bryan wagon.
But by far the most popular and most effective
music in the world, if well rendered, is the exercise
of the human voice in song.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> To open a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
meeting with music always strikes a sympathetic
chord with the people. It aids and strengthens
every word that follows. If our speakers do not
know how to sing when they start out, they
should practice singing our songs until they do
know. This should be part of the young speaker's
education.</p>


<h3>STEREOPTICON PICTURES.</h3>

<p>Another advantage of the "Bryan wagon" is
that it can carry a certain amount of baggage the
"shoe leather traveler" cannot possibly take with
him. For those who do not possess an unusual
oratorical talent, a small stereopticon or magic
lantern with views picturing the principles of the
New Democracy in effective colors, will prove a
valuable aid. Reform stereopticon views have
been produced in great variety, and the method
of enlisting the eye wherever possible to
strengthen the impressions made through the ear
is sound policy. In securing collections for the
payment of expenses, the average citizen is more
likely to give his nickel or dime towards the support
of the travelers if he has heard a dime's
worth of music or seen a dime's worth of comic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and interesting pictures in addition to instruction
gotten through the medium of the speaker's
voice.</p>


<h3>BICYCLES AND DEMOCRACY.</h3>

<p>Where a man doesn't care to walk, and where
it is inconvenient or distasteful to travel by means
of the "Bryan wagon," that most modern and
popular conveyance, the bicycle, should not be
despised as a means of disseminating truth. The
bicycle is one of the revolutionary factors of our
age. It is the enemy of tobacco, liquor and all
other vices that arise from abnormal desires created
by a sedentary life. It is the friend of
health, strength, red cheeks and clear heads.
Where there are good roads it is an excellent
means of travel, and a strong wheelman can easily
speak every night at a different town by using
the wheel, and still have plenty of time to advertise
each outdoor meeting.</p>

<p>A bicycle, too, is an excellent companion to a
Bryan wagon, because while the wagon is slowly
moving from one village to another, the wheelman
can be scouring along the side roads distributing
small circulars to the scattered country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>men,
telling them of the meeting in the next town
the coming day or night. In fact, one of the
most important truths for every friend of the New
Democracy to learn while very young, is that
our enemy, plutocracy, utilizes every invention
and element of civilization for the perpetuation
of its power. In opposing plutocracy we cannot
be narrow, prejudiced, superstitious, nor allow
preconceived ideas as to dignity, custom, personal
appearance or respectability, to interfere
with our free motion and our energetic conflict.</p>

<p>We fight with every weapon that by any honorable
means can be secured. We travel by every
means that will emancipate us from the limitations
of time, space and poverty. We accept as
allies every friend who will aid in impressing upon
our fellow mortals the solemnity of the opportunity
that confronts them and the malignity of
the enemy that is destroying our common race
and country.</p>

<p>Grasp every force in earth, in sea, in air, which
by ingenuity, wisdom, persistence, or heroism can
be utilized in lessening human pain or adding to
human joy; which can be of service in forwarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
these grand principles that will, by one social and
political transition, abolish the primary sources of
human misery.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
SALOON MEETINGS.</h2></div>


<p>A young man, of splendid physique, of bright
and formidable eye, the very picture of strength
and courage, who became an admirer of Mr.
Bryan during the late campaign, and, after careful
and extensive reading forsook the Republican
party, embraced the New Democracy and enlisted
the week following the election as a Volunteer
Speaker and worker. He is an active
member of the Young Men's Christian Association
and of the Christian Endeavor Society.</p>

<p>The first meeting he was asked to attend was
held over a saloon. This image of youthful
power and courage walked through the bar-room
of the saloon with a disparaging air, sat down at
a table beside the writer, answered a few questions
in a gloomy and dissatisfied manner and
said diplomatically that he had an engagement at
another end of the city and could not remain.
He had promised to help arrange another meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>ing
a few blocks away and the next day partly
fulfilled that promise by carrying a bundle of
circulars from the printing office to two men
who were to distribute them. He then suddenly
dropped out of sight and has never, so far as the
movement is concerned, shown up since.</p>

<p>It has been learned that to a fellow churchman
he remarked that he had been attracted by the
high and noble ideals of Mr. Bryan, had expected
to work for the cause, but that his attendance
at a meeting in a saloon was so offensive
to him that he lost all heart and had given
up participation in the movement in consequence.</p>

<p>This man is only the type of a considerable
class who would like to have their fellow
beings clean but would never help wash
them, who would dearly love to have them good
but are too narrow to help save them; who admire
the poetry of patriotism but who cowardly
shrink from those sterner duties of which patriotism
consists.</p>

<p>Think of a follower of Jesus Christ refusing to
preach patriotism to men because they are gath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>ered
in or over a saloon, after having been denied
the opportunity of meeting in a church or
even a church yard. If Jesus Christ had been
so squeamish and "gentlemanly" as to have
confined his services to the respectable people,
the early church would have died before it
was born. In no age has there been sufficient
vitality in the classes that call themselves respectable
to give permanent form to any social
or religious movement. Those who wish to do
great things only in a respectable manner never
do great things. A man cannot at the same time
be both great and respectable.</p>

<p>In order to be respectable, he must stifle genius
and cover with the ashes of artificiality all the
deepest passions of the soul. He must destroy
his individuality and trim his sympathies as he
does his beard, like the barbarous Northmen
when they entered Rome.</p>

<p>Love for humanity that can be checked or dissipated
by inartistic surroundings, contact with
vice or the coarse companionship of intemperate
men is not love at all, it is a mere fad, a fitful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
remnant of a religious instinct long since eaten
out from within.</p>

<p>Imagine a mother talking about how she loves
to have her baby clean and sweet and wholesome,
and then picture her refusing to undergo
the hardship required in making her child sweet
and clean and wholesome. Such a mother would
be no mother at all, unless, perchance, a stepmother
or mother-in-law.</p>

<p>The young man referred to is a typical specimen
of a sniveling, impracticable and worthless
counterfeit of religion, the only function of
which is to emasculate and weaken our youth.
It serves to ease their consciences and displace
the instincts that prompt to goodness. For courageous
self-sacrifice, it substitutes the mumbling
of prayers; instead of active, righteous contact
with the world it demands the attendance at meetings
in which love is expressed toward a phantasy
millions of miles up into the stars, while the
Living God of Heaven and earth is forgotten,
and where imprecation, denunciation and charges
of wickedness are dealt out to those manly and
courageous persons who lift out a helping hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to the poor instead of praying for them and who
fight to make this world and this life heavenly
instead of paying their debts to their fellow creatures
with mansions in the skies.</p>

<p>The refusal of this young man who, according
to his own statement, believed that the future
welfare of the Nation depended upon the triumph
of the principles represented by Mr. Bryan, to assist
in spreading those principles in saloon meetings,
means that his religious and social training
had unfitted him to do any great or noble thing,
unless in conformity with his Sunday-school
manufactured tastes as to nicety and elegance.</p>

<p>The young man sees the giant tree, injustice,
and offers to assist in cutting it down but, when
we hand him an ax, refuses to take off his coat
and returns it saying that his little hatchet at
home has a blue ribbon around it and that he
won't cut with any other.</p>

<p>He sings "Rescue the Perishing" at the Christian
Endeavor meeting, a pretty girl with pink
cheeks and cherry lips on each side. The
cheeks and lips and song are so pleasing, he
thinks he will go further and help rescue the per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>ishing.
After careful study he is satisfied that
people are perishing for want of his friendly services
and the services of others like himself.
Yet, when he is assigned a place to work, he abruptly
leaves his post of duty and goes back to
prayer meeting, because, poor boy, no carpet is
on the floor, no angel pictures grace the wall, and
the tobacco smoke about him is offensive.</p>

<p>Innocent creature! Let him continue to sing
his hymns and say his prayers surrounded by
pretty girls In the Christian Endeavor meeting
and pretty boys who should have been born girls,
while the great forces of reform fight the battles
of the living God, conquer evil, destroy injustice
and lift up the fallen. We can do without him
and without his kind.</p>

<p>Not that we want to. We do not. We need
all possible help. We will not judge harshly
all those who now are given over to such innocent
amusements. For the delicate white hand,
the girlish student face, the timid mamma's
boy, taken from the prayer meeting and the
Christian Endeavor Society, once taught to
see the great truths of social salvation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
human progress, does not always retreat in
holy horror when confronted with conflict and
the smoke of battle. On the other hand, such
timid, singing, praying boys often become National
heroes. Before manhood is discovered by
the growth of hair on the face, manly character
sometimes reaches maturity, with qualities developed,
not only superior to tobacco smoke at a
saloon meeting, and the naughty cuss words
of the fellows who drink there, but to the smoke
of powder and the thunder of cannon.</p>

<p>Do not overlook nor belittle soft men, but ignore
only those who stay soft after you have
tried the hardening process. For where one
heart may be formed of milk and water, the
liquid state of another may be that of molten
steel, and may only require the cooling process
of an outdoor breeze to make it withstand
the continuous persecution and conflict of years.</p>

<p>There is no unholy place where men should
not go who are fired by a passion for justice.
It is a fact that one of the centers of the social
life of the great cities of America and of Europe
is the liquor saloon. How much we may deplore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
this fact or the evil results that we see flowing
from it, is entirely another question. The fact
remains in spite of our deploring, our shocked
ideals or our sympathies wrung by the desolation
and death caused by it, that the center of the
social life of our great cities, the place where society
meets, (not that floating, top-heavy buoy
that calls itself society, but real society, the people)
is the liquor saloon.</p>

<p>At present it is managed in America, not with
any reference whatever to its social function, but
merely for the private profit of individuals. In
order to increase their private profits and to defend
their special interests, the men who manage
these saloons, as a general rule, abuse their
powers and add inconceivably to the horrors of
the vice of intemperence trying, by unnatural and
vicious methods, to increase their gain.</p>

<p>Not only this, but as the saloon is the center of
the social life of our American cities, the proprietors
of saloons and the manufacturers of liquors,
who have associated their interests, have a
terrible and unnatural advantage in controlling
the political power of the people with whom they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
come in contact. They do not have to go where
the people are because the saloon keeper, in the
natural and usual performance of his business, is
already in the midst of the people. He always
has a crowd. He is the greatest preacher of modern
times. He does not have to invent new
methods for REACHING THE MASSES. He
does not have to scratch his bald head and say,
"O, Lord! why are my sheep deserting me?" The
saloon keeper always has a congregation, always
a choir, is always surrounded by men in need of a
friend, and, like other members of the human
family having a strange mixture of greed and
sympathy, cruelty and fellow-feeling, he exercises
his charitable instincts and lends a material helping
hand to the members of his congregation quite
as often as do the five thousand and twenty thousand
dollar a year ministers who preach not to
men drinking, but often to men who have already
drunk their fill.</p>

<p>The saloon keeper preacher, however, lacks one
advantage possessed by his more fortunate compeer
of the church pulpit, for, where a member
of the saloon congregation has a perfect right to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
answer back and correct misstatements, slanders
and unjust vituperation, the friend of the common
people who happens into the fashionable city
church service must bite his lips and remain
silent while the name of Jesus, the revolutionist,
the poor man's friend, is used to strengthen vile
calumny against His brave modern apostles who
are fighting to realize practically in government
the principles represented by the cross.</p>

<p>Therefore, one of the most promising fields for
the social reformer, for the man who drinks beer
and the man who drinks water, for the man who
smokes cigars and the man who washes his teeth
before every meal with charcoal powder and lives
on vegetables, is the liquor saloon. It is always
open and you can go in without buying. You
can take a seat free of charge and you can talk.
You have as much right to talk as the bartender,
and even if opposed to your principles, good
business judgment, if no other motive, prompts
the average saloon keeper to be tolerant. He
cannot afford to drive away any large percentage
of his customers. You have a right,
and even in the Republican saloons you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
get permission to declare the gospel of monopoly's
downfall in the back room, in the hall
upstairs or in the main saloon, once a week, without
paying anything for heat, light or hall
rent. These are already furnished for the people
who now go there. You do not need to advertise
the meeting, for there is always a crowd about
the saloon. After you have held two or three
meetings they will grow in size and draw the frequenters
from other resorts.</p>

<p>The average saloon crowd is as open to conviction
and as ready to be taught concerning
the moralizing of government and the establishment
of justice in the world as the average church
congregation, and they will treat you as civilly
and listen as attentively even though every man
present disagrees with you.</p>

<p>Let the hundreds of saloons throughout our
great cities be selected as a mission field for the
new gospel of manliness and brotherhood.
Christ went among publicans and wine-bibbers.
We can afford to go among wine-bibbers, even
when they are Republicans. Our crowd may be
small at times but the kind of work that moves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the world and builds up civilization is work that
is regular and continuous.</p>

<p>Let the Volunteers organize by twos, and the
one, two or three evenings a week that they can
give to the cause, let those who choose this
work go to a saloon and tell the fellows there
that under a proper social system, each one of
them can afford to have a home as sociable and
homelike and comfortable as a saloon; that,
after they declare their independence of the party
whip, and, instead of obeying parties, command
them to do their bidding, they can soon have such
opportunities that they won't have to drink to forget
their troubles, because they will have no
troubles; that they won't have to drink in order
to imagine that they are happy, because they will
have real happiness; that after the gold standard
and monopoly are overthrown, there will be a
hundred different pleasures and opportunities
opened to them, that these will produce intoxication
just as delicious as that produced by wine
and beer, and that every poor man who wants
to drink will be allowed to drink, not slops and
refuse, but the same fluids that now give the gout
and dropsy to die millionaire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
The way to get up a saloon meeting is to see
the proprietor, tell him you are a Democrat, not
a fraudulent, makebelieve hypocrite, using the
Democratic name to defeat Democratic principles,
not an agent of the gold bugs trying to corrupt
the Democratic party, not an attorney for
monopoly attempting to pervert the Democratic
organization to help millionaires rob Democratic
voters, but that you are a real dyed-in-the-wool,
anti-monopoly, Jeffersonian, Jacksonian, Bryan
Democrat, standing with all fours on the Chicago
platform, the enemy of its enemies, the foe of its
traducers, and the opponent, uncompromising and
implacable of every man who upholds the infamous
British Rothschild gold standard of
money. Tell him that you would like to talk to
his customers and a few others in his place every
week, and show them how, by united political action
in the Democratic party, they can be made
just as happy as if they were drunk seven days
each week.</p>

<p>He will let you come, and if you talk straight
from the shoulder, you will have a larger crowd
at the second meeting than at the first. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
keep the work up a year continuously, you will
not only have your name enrolled in the book of
heroes, kept by the Democratic leaders, but also
in the book kept by the Divinity who guides the
Nations. You will be rewarded in this world for
your sacrificing labor if you live until the people
crush monopoly, and if not, you will at least have
that consciousness of duty done which knows no
time nor space.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
THE HEROIC AND PROSAIC.</h2></div>


<p>Heroism and the spirit of martyrdom and of
self-sacrifice are historical factors as real, as tangible
and as much a part of human nature as greed
or hunger. The young Volunteers who forsake
home, business and personal ambition to help
save our Nation from the money power, starting
in the name of humanity astride bicycles, horseback,
afoot and in Bryan wagons, preaching the
new gospel of glad tidings without money and
without price, eating whole wheat, dry bread and
apples, with a square meal only now and then to
remind them of the good times coming, are not
impelled by any strange or new force in society.
They are not the disciples of a new cult or ism,
the latest off-shot from the great tree of life.
They are not a new product of civilization but on
the other hand they are the real conservative and
belong to the true nobility of the human race,
that brotherhood of heroes, patriots and martyrs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of all ages and nations, as old as the human family
itself.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the essentially NEW PRODUCT
of our civilization is the man who does not
believe in heroism, who has stifled the nobler instincts
with which nature originally endowed him,
and fills his whole mind's horizon with the one
image of gold. Those in whose minds avarice
has devoured all other instincts and desires to the
point of moral insanity, are the only strange or
new off-shoots. They alone are the special and
characteristic product of our particular period, distinguished
above all else by its complete surrender
to the one passion&mdash;greed. The real cranks and
monstrosities are not those who are in line with
historic humanity, but rather those who have
crucified their humanity on "a cross of gold" in
accord with a temporary social perversion.</p>


<h3>HEROISM AND SOMETHING MORE.</h3>

<p>Some say it is the weakness of our movement
that we depend too much on heroism and
patriotism and other of the weaker instincts and
uncertain qualities of human nature and therefore
the movement must fail. Successful movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
appeal to the more substantial motives and instincts,
such as cupidity, sectional pride, etc.</p>

<p>While it is true that we appeal first of all to
the patriotism of our citizens, to the heroic in
man and to those deep religious and moral sentiments
of which heroism and patriotism are the
highest product, and while it is true that we regard
these sentiments when fully drawn out and
properly applied, and during great occasions of
National peril, as being stronger than cupidity,
sectional pride, or even regard for life, and that
the exercise of these qualities by vast bodies of
men have repeatedly, during each century
throughout the history of our race, saved the
dominance of the Caucasian race and all those
principles and institutions that give value to the
modern world, and, while we intend during the
four years to come, preparatory to the greatest
crisis of history, to continue to appeal first and
foremost and all the time to patriotism and heroism,
love of justice and fellow feeling, still, we intend
to utilize every force and every means that
will aid in bringing about the better world for
which we hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
We recognize that while in a moment of enthusiastic
ardor, a man will give his life for a
principle, and that during hours of deep religious
fervor, brought about by the preaching of gifted
orators, people renounce their old ways of living
and often divide up their property with the church
and the poor, that such occasions are comparatively
rare, while every man born of woman desires
food about three times a day, that he desires
clothing and suffers for the want of it during
every one of his sleeping and waking hours,
that during a large portion of his life intense feelings
and regard are turned toward some woman,
and that nearly all men are at nearly all times vain,
not in any bad sense, but that they desire the respect
and the confidence of their fellow men, and
when opportunity offers, strive to be conspicuous
and influential, and desire to be feared and loved
and admired for unusual qualities, possessions
or acts.</p>

<p>Therefore, to make our movement completely
and wholly successful, we appeal first to patriotism
and heroism, the noblest and highest qualities
produced by centuries of religious and moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
training, but secondarily we appeal to men's ambition,
their love of gain, their desire to eat, to
be clothed, to marry, to become influential, their
vanity, their imagination, their love of activity and
all the qualities that they possess.</p>

<p>It does not lessen a soldier's courage for him
to know that if victorious in battle he is to be
promoted, or that if a city is taken or a country
conquered, he is to have a plantation where he
can rest in peace when his gray hairs come with
his children healthy and happy about him.
There is no need to dissect with the surgeon's
knife of close analysis the motives and minds of
men in order to separate every little vanity from
the noble and unselfish impulses with which it is
interwoven, nor to cut away and lay apart from the
strong patriotic desire to serve one's country,
every little individual and personal hope that
in the event one's country is served and saved,
those who bear the brunt of the battle will be
especially favored and secure first recognition in
the universal enjoyment consequent upon such
victory. By taking human nature as we find it
with its admixture of the heroic and prosaic, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
mingling of selfish and altruistic aims, we seek
to make every impulse serve the cause of humanity
by contributing to the one end&mdash;triumphant
Democracy.</p>


<h3>THE ROLL OF HONOR.</h3>

<p>The most important feature of the Democratic
Volunteers' organization, is the honor roll, on
which is recorded the work done by each Volunteer.
To all faithful workers are issued semi-annually
certificates of honor, and to those who
perform services of unusual merit special medals
and other awards of recognition.</p>

<p>One copy of the honor roll is kept by the National
leaders in a safe-deposit in St. Louis, and
a duplicate copy by the great leader of Democracy
at his home.</p>

<p>By this system, each worker knows that everything
he does is recorded at headquarters, and is
kept there for all future time for reference by our
national leaders, when they wish, either in asking
for services or bestowing favors, to find the
real, deserving, fighting material in our party.
Each worker knows, also, that it is the end of the
unjust custom, whereby one or two loud-mouthed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
adventurers, who have done nothing
but who claim all, in the hour of victory cast aside
the unselfish workers, whose years of patient labor
gained the victory. With an account kept of the
sacrifices made, the clubs organized, the members
secured by each party worker in our country,
there can be no more climbing into favor on the
shoulders of others, but, instead, each man stands
on his own bottom, reaping the fruit and recognition
of his own work, and is assigned to leadership
as the result of the exercise of his own genius
and talents. At present, every Congressman,
Governor or President elected to office, is punished
sufficiently to offset all the pleasures and
satisfactions of having been successful by the impossible
task of trying to disentangle the various
claims of the men who helped elect him. But no
such discordant scramble need ever recur, for
the Volunteers will, in the future, keep an exact
history of the service rendered by every party
worker, and, in Congressional parlance, each
fellow will know exactly "where he is at." The
system is as carefully thought out and perfected
as that of any standing army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
The roll of honor appeals to the strongest instincts
in man, which have been utilized in every
successful social or religious movement since the
dawn of history. If he is vain, it appeals to his
vanity. If heroic, it stimulates his heroism. If
ambitious, he sees the way to get place and
position is to merit them by faithful work and
that they cannot be had by cheating the rightful
owners out of the fruits of their victories, to
which he has not contributed.</p>

<p>In the Catholic Church and in many other institutions
through all the centuries, as among
the followers of Napolean and Caesar, men have
often given up their lives for a medal or a bit of
ribbon. For such rewards England to-day gets
almost as much service as from her vast pay-roll.</p>

<p>By proper organization, vanity can be made
to offset cupidity. It is as strong an instinct, and
we have the means of satisfying it. To-day the
name of England's Queen cannot inspire as great
enthusiasm in the majority of the English speaking
race, as does the name of William Jennings
Bryan. The enthusiasm now aroused has sufficient
force to accomplish all our ends. What we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
need is simply to harness this Niagara, organize
this power, and apply it systematically and continuously.
It can be done. It is being done.
Never in the history of our country has the year
following a great political campaign been the
scene of such a rejuvenation of the defeated
party as has taken place since our late repulse.</p>

<p>As every plant must shoot down two roots for
sustenance, before putting forth a new twig, so
we have decided to plant the roots of our organization
prolifically throughout the Southern and
Western states, where our cause is strong, thereby
securing the support for a continuous and aggressive
campaign before sending our Volunteers into
the doubtful states and those still given over to
the idolatrous worship of the golden calf.</p>

<p>Each congressional district in the Southern and
Western states can be made by contributions of
one cent, five cents, ten cents at a time, collected
by the Volunteer Speakers, to support permanently
one organizer in Republican territory.</p>

<p>There are many different ways to work. One
is by educating and agitating and by advancing
our principles indoors and outdoors upon every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
possible occasion by public speeches. Another
is to go to work quietly, and, by personal man-to-man
solicitation, to organize regular ward or precinct
clubs in one's own town or county. This
is the first thing to be done, where no regular
Democratic club exists independent of boodling
bosses. But, anyhow, get five true and tried
workers enlisted and forward their names to
headquarters. They will then receive monthly
instructions for carrying on and enlarging the
work. When a club is already formed, the Volunteer
is to build it up by increasing its membership
and educating its members, and defeating,
as club officers, any man who is known to apologize
for the existence of any monopoly whatever.
After this try to establish a league of the clubs
in the county, city or state, known to be formed
on right principles.</p>

<p>In the centuries to come, there will be no
prouder title to boast of, no higher family honor,
no more distinctive mark of aristocracy, than
this record in black and white that one's forefather
belonged to the band of patriots who,
through four years of persecution and struggle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
succeeded in driving from American soil, that
last representative of historic tyranny, organized
plutocracy.</p>

PRACTICAL POLITICS.</h2></div>


<p>In a cause as holy as ours, false modesty is
as unwise as false dignity. When we realize that
money represents human effort, that it gives
multiplied power either in war or peace and that
the possession of money, with its accompanying
power to an almost unlimited extent, is enjoyed
by our enemies, it is well for us to admit at the
start that we, every Volunteer of us, must make
constant efforts wherever speaking or working,
to raise funds, on however small a scale, for the
great work before us. One humble but time-honored
method, which has proved useful in every
popular movement, recorded in history, is that of
"taking up a collection." People may laugh at
it and the collections be small but we must not
be deterred by ridicule nor discouraged by the
apparent insignificance of the returns. This is
the only way to give all the people systematically
and persistently a chance to contribute accord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>ing
to ability to the cause that means liberty and
the opening of opportunity to them. Therefore,
let no speaker listen to advice from the timid
and over-modest, who shrink from the sneers and
taunts of the over-nice, but at every meeting let
them pass around the hat after the manner of our
forefathers. We must also remember that in
every audience, however small, there may be some
penitent Croesus awake to existing evils but as
yet with no clear vision of a remedy, with power
and will to help but lacking knowledge as to
where such help should be given. Sudden conversions
are not unknown where the message of
truth is delivered with sincerity and simplicity.
There are thousands of rich men at this moment
who, if properly appealed to, would give liberally
to the cause that to them seemed likely to
promote the general welfare. There are many
human hearts now waiting, like the Pool of Bethesda,
for the angel's touch, which shall "trouble"
their calm and transform them into sources of
healing for the woes of humanity. No speaker
knows but he may be the one destined to open up
these closed fountains of power. The heights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and depths of human nature lie beyond our
ordinary vision. A man's power of response to
an appeal in behalf of those who suffer is not
always graven on his forehead, so that "he that
runneth may read." In any audience there may
be some listener, apparently indifferent, in whom
all the preliminary processes of conversion have
already taken place, and who needs only the
warm breath of an atmosphere charged with unselfish
enthusiasm to complete the work of regeneration.
Such cases are on record. Within
a few years, the gift of a million dollars was received
by the promoters of a reform movement in
New York, not from an habitual contributor to
such enterprises, but from a sudden convert, a
man ordinarily cold and indifferent to humanitarian
movements, and before unresponsive to his
brothers' needs. Perhaps it was not the need
that previously had failed to stir his heart, but
only the methods of helping that had not satisfied
his mind. There are rich men and women to-day,
honestly desirous of bringing about better
social conditions and willing to make sacrifices to
that end, but who, so far, have found none of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
methods suggested practicable. To such we
may appeal with certainty of response, thereby
being furnished with the sinews of war by those
who owe their wealth to the very system we
oppose.</p>

<p>And why not? Because a man has been
thrown into a brutal and wasteful contest and has
come victorious from the struggle is no reason
why he should wish his children and humanity
at large to be forced into another of the same
kind. Such a man well knows that he, too, in
spite of apparent success, is also a victim. He
sees the possibilities of life under a better social
system&mdash;the order, the beauty, the harmony, the
possible development of higher faculties and extinction
of those that link him with the brutes.
All this he sees, and even while scrambling with
the rest for possession of the booty, he would
hail with joy any change that promised to relieve
his children from a like sad necessity.</p>

<p>Starve fifty Sunday school teachers for a week,
lock them in a cage together, throw in a roast of
beef, a plum pudding, a pitcher of soup, a plate
of pickles and a pot of beans, at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
telling each to get what he can, as no more will
be furnished for a month; and a swinish scramble
will at once ensue, in which two thirds of the food
will be wasted, and in the end one man will have
a pocket full of plum pudding, another a handful
of pickles, and the strongest the roast beef to himself
in a corner.</p>

<p>Let it be understood that he who gets the
roast beef is no worse than the others, nor will
he, because of his success, NECESSARILY
favor an indefinite continuation of such brutal
scrambling. The difference between him and the
least successful is a difference in strength, NOT
NECESSARILY A DIFFERENCE IN AIM.
To-day, most men are actuated by the same spirit.
To desire success and a share of life's gifts is
right and normal. It is the political system under
which we live that has transformed this natural
and healthy impulse into a devilish desire to absorb
not only all wealth but all opportunities.</p>

<p>To remedy this radical evil, it is not enough to
change individuals; we must change the system.
It is, of course, to be expected that the impulse to
change our present barbarous monopolistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
methods will come from those who have failed in
the scramble for riches. For the possession of
wealth naturally tends to promote in the minds
of those who possess it, a certain degree of satisfaction
with the methods by which it has been
acquired and a tendency to oppose any change.
A spirit of toadyism and fear of social ostracism
also induces many to sacrifice their highest ideals.
Great fortunes often destroy the independence
which it might be supposed they would secure to
their possessors; yet, in spite of the temptations
of wealth and the unwritten, but none the less
rigidly enforced mandates of a heartless society,
not a few are ready to make the required sacrifices
in order to advance the interests of our common
humanity.</p>

<p>To such partially awakened minds, it ought not
to be difficult to show that the times are ripe for
a solution of existing problems other than that
offered by charitable associations. For eighteen
centuries the Good Samaritan has been the working
model of the church and society, yet the number
of the wounded and robbed on the world's
highway has so increased that the gigantic sys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>tems
of modern charity are inadequate to meet the
increasing demands upon them. Why? The
answer is clear. No very keen intelligence is required
to see that one very important duty has
been neglected by the Good Samaritans of all
times. Occupied with caring for the wounded,
they have neglected to hunt down the thieves,
who have accordingly increased in numbers and
boldness. It is time for us to leave effects and
study causes, to organize at once to hunt down
the thieves, for, when these are routed, there will
be fewer victims on whom to exercise charity.
Why plan educational and charitable institutions
in the slums when the causes that produce the
slums are left untouched? Why add another to
the five hundred churches of a great city, when
the influence of the money power makes the
preaching of the real gospel well nigh impossible,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
thus largely destroying the usefulness of those
already built? Instead of new homes of charity,
let us organize to end the need for charity. Instead
of building one new school, the true educator
will ally himself with those forces that seek,
through public action, to place education within
the reach of all. Instead of building a new
church, the devout Christian or Jew will divide
his substance with the party that aims to make
possible the application of the principles of religion
to the everyday affairs of life and to all
social institutions.</p>

<p>Never was there a cause that appealed more
strongly than ours to a man's generous instincts.
In the middle ages all Europe was fired by the
idea of wresting the Holy Sepulchre from infidel
hands; to-day Greek and Cuban patriots are laying
everything upon their country's altar for the
sake of national honor and freedom. Our cause
is nobler, larger than any of these. Not Christ's
tomb, but the race He died to redeem; not an
insignificant nation, but humanity is through us
pleading to be rescued and restored to liberty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Our appeal is not to a class, a church or a nation;
it is to MEN for MAN.</p>

<p>ONE DOLLAR GIVEN TO OUR CAUSE
WILL ACCOMPLISH MORE FOR THE
ALLEVIATION OF HUMAN SUFFERING,
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRUE
CIVILIZATION, THAN FIVE HUNDRED
DOLLARS SPENT FOR ANY COLLEGE,
CHARITY OR CHURCH. As hundreds of
poor men have sacrificed all they possessed, given
up home and the comforts of family life, to travel
from town to town urging the principles of the
New Democracy; so will there be rich men, who,
feeling their RELATIONSHIP TO HUMANITY
TO BE MORE BINDING than any ties
uniting them with a selfish class, will also give
up the larger part of what they have and lay it on
the altar of their country.</p>

<p>Those who feel the divine impulse to give to
this movement will give double by giving promptly,
and will have the added personal joy of seeing
some of the results of their generosity. Not all
the results, because each dollar given to this
cause starts a train of consequences for the hap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>piness
of men and for the peace of society that
will continue as long as this old earth is inhabited
by mortals. The effect of every penny, given by
the smallest child or the poorest servant girl, may
produce results for good that will be felt by mankind
through all the generations to come.</p>

<p>It is not unreasonable for us to ask for constantly,
and to expect to receive a single donation
of a million dollars sometime during the coming
four years. Such donations have many times
been given to causes less holy than ours, and in
emergencies not to be compared to it in importance.
We can in reason hope for several gifts
of not less than twenty-five thousand dollars each,
and many of not less than one thousand dollars,
and thousands of lesser gifts proportionate to the
purses of the poor who will regard it not as a
duty, but as a privilege to thus co-operate with
God. Such amounts have been subscribed to a
single college and to a single religious denomination
within the memory of the youngest reader.
Can we not rationally expect that even more will
be given to the movement which is to multiply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
many times the usefulness of all colleges and
churches?</p>

<p>But do not trim your sails nor adapt your arguments
to the rich, in order to secure donations,
but speak bravely and fearlessly in behalf of justice
and the rights of the people, and, if special
selfish interests are thereby alienated, unselfish
interests will be drawn to us.</p>

<p>Although generous help may be expected from
those who have been enriched by the very system
that we seek to destroy, nevertheless it is a fact
that, as a class, the rich are satisfied with the
system of injustice that has given them their
riches, and, as a class, will oppose now, as they
have opposed during all history, every reform or
change that promises improvement to the masses.
Therefore the bulk of the money to be raised for
the people's cause must probably be given by the
people themselves according to their means.</p>

<p>We should for this reason not only call for
donations and pass around the hat at meetings
when the people are enthusiastic, but, in forming
clubs in every township throughout our
country, we should try to induce each to ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>point
its most active and popular man as Treasurer,
and especially to instruct him to collect
every week or month, a regular subscription,
HOWEVER SMALL, from every friend of our
movement in his community. In this way, we can
establish a system similar to "Peter's Pence," and
the missionary contributions of the Protestant
churches, and raise a fund during the coming
four years that will be a wonder to ourselves and
a menace to our enemies.</p>

<p>It may be asked, if the Volunteer Speakers
work without pay, many of them living on heroic
diet and traveling on foot, what need of money?
To this it may be replied that the legitimate and
honest uses for money in promoting any cause
are too many to enumerate. The field is large
and workers of many kinds are needed. Though
many of our speakers will travel and work continuously
without compensation and the vast
majority will give their time without any reward
even for their expenses, still, to utilize properly
the Volunteer work of the thousands who are willing
to make such sacrifices, it is very desirable
that we have at least one paid organizer in each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Congressional District, and, if possible, in each
county one who will receive a moderate salary
and who will be held responsible for all the routine
work required in his territory. The Volunteer
workers and speakers in any locality can be
made many times as effective, if there is some one
man responsible to the national office for the
methodical arrangement of the work and the
systematic utilization of their services. It is also
highly desirable that every Volunteer be given a
bountiful supply of the very best literature on
economic subjects. Money is also needed for our
central school for Volunteer Speakers in St.
Louis, where those with hearts afire to speak for
Democracy can come, and within one, two or
three months, be trained and equipped with a
practical knowledge of the details of the work in
which they wish to engage.</p>

<p>But it is folly to enlarge further upon the need
of money. Every person who appreciates the
nature of our struggle knows that everything we
do can be done more effectively with additional
funds.</p>

FUNDAMENTALS.</h2></div>


<p>To educate the people, the first essential is that
the educators know exactly what they wish to
teach and the ultimate purpose of such teaching.</p>

<p>In the previous chapters are outlined methods
of reaching and persuading people. More important,
however, than any manner of speaking,
traveling, advertising or gaining an audience is
it that our speakers never lose sight of the few
great basic principles of our movement, and that
they keep these central truths steadily before the
eyes and minds of the people.</p>

<p>The principal danger to be overcome in every
popular movement is that in the adaptation of the
central truth of the movement to local and temporary
requirements, the truth itself may be lost
in a multitude of petty intricacies.</p>

<p>In the beginnings of the great religions when
they spread irresistibly over the world, their teachers
held firmly to a few great salient truths. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the influence of every religion waned when its
ministers, forgetting its real object, gave themselves
up to details of worship and church government.
This is also the history of nearly every
Christian denomination. In their vigor and
youth, they dwelt principally upon the great primary
themes. When these were forgotten or neglected,
the movements themselves lost their
power.</p>

<p>The weakness of the people's movement to-day
is that our leaders abandon too often the
center of the stream, drawn away by the side currents
and little eddies. The intricacies of finance,
statistics and details of administration, often absorb
their whole attention. Those who would
guide the crowd to a higher civilization forget the
object of their endeavors, the crowd forgets; then
medley and Babel. Instead of marching toward
the goal, the multitude halt by the wayside,
and go to arguing over the incidents of the journey.
The compass, governed by fixed and universal
laws, that acts regardless of the turns in the
road, no longer directs them. They are at the
mercy of the local, the incidental and temporary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
When they give up the main road to wander off
in bypaths, unity and progress cease; division,
disorder and disintegration begin.</p>

<p>The silver question, the question as to the
power of the Supreme Court Justices, the railway
question, are all merely incidental to the one
great fundamental conflict that has been waged
for centuries, the conflict of the general welfare
resting on right against the special interests that
thrive by wrong, of liberty against tyranny; the
people against plutocracy. This conflict should
be kept in the forefront by every Volunteer,
who should urge continuously and repeatedly
upon his hearers the few great simple truths of
Democracy, holding these out in bold relief, like
mountains above the rolling slopes and projecting
crags that lead up to them, keeping the popular
mind centered on the goal of their efforts,
the North Star, as it were, of progress.</p>

<p>Revolutions and special evolutions are brought
about in human affairs, NOT SO MUCH BY
THE DISSEMINATION OF A GREAT
MULTITUDE OF IDEAS, AS BY THE CONCENTRATION
OF A MULTITUDE OF<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
MINDS UPON A SINGLE IDEA. This
single idea, however, cannot be of a local or
temporary nature. It must, on the other
hand, be comprehensive and of sufficient import
to stir the very souls of the masses. A mere
question of currency, transportation or judicial
powers, however important, even if absolutely requisite
to further progress, is not capable of producing
the universal enthusiasm required to institute
any fundamental innovation. The truths
on which the popular mind is to be focused, must
be self-evident, general, and their application not
limited to a short time or a special locality. With
the people's attention fixed upon a great moral
truth universally applicable, their faces all turned
toward, their eyes fixed on one star of deliverance,
it is easy to convince them that to realize
their goal no sacrifice can be too great. Men are
prepared to act intelligently concerning currency,
transportation or other incidental reforms when
their enthusiasm and purpose are fully aroused
and their attention is fixed upon universal laws
about which there can be no doubt, hesitancy or
confusion. Absorbed in great things, the petty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
causes of strife and dissension disappear. We
can gain unity only when, leaving details to tried
leaders, the people concentrate their attention on
those simple realities, self-evident and capable of
being understood by all, the attainment of which
forces the righteous settlement of details and of
all questions dependent and incidental.</p>


<h3>THE WORLD BIG; GOD GOOD; MAN
ALONE RESPONSIBLE.</h3>

<p>The first such central truth, self-evident to every
man, to be proclaimed tirelessly by the Volunteers,
is that the earth is large enough and rich
enough to supply all the good things of life to
every human being born on it. Urge that especially
since the triumphs of modern science is it
possible for man to satisfy every natural craving,
every healthy desire, every reasonable hope and
dream, without any man being compelled to sacrifice
another human being to his purpose.</p>

<p>The great and the humblest mind alike can see
this truth. It stands out an impregnable tower
of strength above all minor and subsidiary questions.
It is unanswerable, incontravertible and
DYNAMICALLY IRRESISTIBLE. The earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
is large enough and rich enough and human
energy sufficient to produce in abundance everything
required to supply every natural, healthful
human desire. This means that the world, now
made hell by human greed abetted by ignorance
and prejudice, might just as well be heaven. The
misery caused by poverty, tyranny and neglect,
can be displaced by happiness, plenty and liberty
for all.</p>

<p>Following this and demonstrable from it by
the eternal laws of Logic is the conclusion that
the one primary and all-important duty of every
man seeing it is to do all he can, after providing
for his simplest physical wants, to help systematize
and civilize human effort and overcome
prejudice so as to obtain this result.</p>

<p>The immediate effect of the practical acceptance
of this one self-evident truth is almost inconceivable.
Once convince men that their sufferings
are unnecessary, that science has placed in their
hands all the power and materials needed which
rightly applied will give to all men the satisfaction
of all their normal desires, and you at once
transform the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
The most formidable obstacle in the way of
further progress is not that men are insufficiently
versed in political economy or lacking in intelligence,
but it is that the people are without hope.
Popular effort has so often been thwarted by selfish
cunning, great moral enthusiasms dissipated
by the science and superior organization of tyranny,
that men have lost heart.</p>

<p>Despair is the chief opponent of progress. Our
greatest need is hope. The people must have
faith that something can be done.</p>

<p>The majority of men know of public measures
that would be beneficial if an upward step were
possible, but they are overwhelmed by a multitude
of incidental obstacles and petty disappointments
that cloud their small horizons and shut
off from sight the great universal and historic
forces that are slowly but surely working out their
destinies.</p>

<p>Convince men that our country is large enough
and rich enough to give them all an opportunity
to work and earn sufficient to support their families
and educate their children properly, convince
them that their present poverty and sufferings are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
wholly the result of social crimes, and, if they can
believe that this change is actually to be brought
about, you change the whole base of their operations
and revolutionize their attitude of mind.
They are then ready to co-operate with those bold
thinkers who have studied out the details of social
progress.</p>

<p>Our speakers cannot dwell too long upon, cannot
repeat too often, this one all-important, fundamental
truth, the basis of all right political thought
and action, namely, that the world is all right, nature
is lavish, God Almighty is generous, and that
human invention has multiplied many times the
gifts that God originally gave to man, and now
the human family might just as well sit down amid
merry-making to the great feast steaming before
us, prepared through ages of endeavor, but for
a miserable dog in the manger.</p>

<p>Proclaim everywhere that organized greed is this
dog. Teach that the highest patriotism consists
in striking it, that the only martyrs are those devoured
by it, that to kill it is the sublime mission
of this generation.</p>

<p>Do not try to teach many things, but urge with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
all the passion of your being at all times and in all
places, the self-evident and fundamental truth that
our world contains everything required to make
men happy. If want exists, it is the result of
crime. Those who profit by this crime try to
convince us that nothing can be done to prevent
it. Our work is to create hope and courage and
let the people know that this crime can be
stopped, the criminals caught and punished, and
the purposes of God and nature be permitted to
proceed unmolested. Tell the people they can
put an end to their sufferings, that misery results
from human, not from natural causes, and that it
need not be. Teach and preach and cry aloud this
one fact. Repeat it indoors and out, with all the
fire and intensity within you. Each convert will
become a center, and our cause will spread irresistibly.</p>

<p>Therefore, Volunteers, do not weary your
hearers with statistics and historical or legal minutiae;
do not cram them with detailed arguments
relating to questions of a local or temporary nature;
do not confuse them by trying to explain all
the intricacies of a financial system soon to perish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
from off the earth. Rather even let the sophistries
of an opponent go unanswered. But concentrate
all your energies upon helping turn the
attention of the people away from petty and vexing
intricacies to these few great central truths,
which, if once clearly seen, make all else plain.</p>

<p>The man who comprehends fully the truth that
our world, since the discoveries of modern science,
is capable of giving every human being all the
good things of life, that as civilization is now
blessed and glorious to some so it can be made
to all&mdash;such a man will forsake all small purposes
at once and devote himself thereafter to the realization
of his ideal. Nothing else in the world
can compare to this work in importance. When
he learns that there is but one great party that
stands for progress, he will immediately ally himself
with that party.</p>

THE CHURCH AS A FIELD.</h2></div>


<p>Though in large cities the shelter admitted to
be the most accessible to the poor, who wish to
discuss methods for improving their condition, is
the corner saloon, yet in country districts it will
be found that the churches still cling to many of
their ancient virtues and will be found open and
hospitable to every traveler who has a suggestion
to make for the good of the community.</p>

<p>Whatever a speaker's prejudices may be against
any church or against all churches, when he consecrates
his life to the cause of humanity through
the Democratic party, he must suppress such prejudices
and regard all buildings as existing for
use. And a true Volunteer is always certain that
the highest use that can be made of any building
in the world is to have taught in it the truths of
human brotherhood and progress as embodied in
the New Democracy.</p>

<p>In securing a church building for purposes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
instruction, it is best not to mention the name of
our movement. The name that we have adopted
being an old name and used by various people for
various purposes has been used upon numerous
occasions by bad people for bad purposes. Even
the word politics, which, in reality, means the
science and art of government, has come to mean,
in the minds of many, a mere personal contest for
gain and position. The sacred banner of Democracy
has often been dragged into these degrading
brawls and the principles designated by
the banner and name lost sight of. For these
reasons and on account of the limitations of the
average human judgment, it is well in dealing
with church committees to discard all political
names and to ask only for permission to speak
in behalf of human brotherhood, social improvement
or methods of helping the poor. The fact
that human brotherhood can only be realized by
men through the establishment of Democratic
principles need not be told the committee, but had
better be reserved for the audience. The fact that
justice is a mere dream, intangible and unreal, unless,
by political action on the part of the many,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the few who profit by injustice are deprived of
their privileges (or, in other words, until the Democratic
program is carried out), makes it eminently
proper that church buildings be opened to our
speakers as often as possible. Of course, when
the churches of a town are controlled by scribes
and Pharisees, as they were when Paul was a
volunteer speaker some centuries ago, unless
some other building can be had, we must follow
Paul's example and make our rostrum in the
open street or field; but where the church buildings
are controlled by Christians instead of gold
worshippers, by sincere men who desire justice and
brotherhood and to help the poor, then, however
different our prejudices, our personal likings or
our superstitions may be, we should grasp our
newly acquainted brothers by the hand and arrange
with them for meetings in the church for
the examination of methods whereby religion can
be made practicable and applied to human affairs.</p>

<p>To the charitable who are really to be found
here and there in the village and agricultural
churches, we must make plain that no amount of
teaching or preaching, applied internally or ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>ternally,
can ever benefit the poor, until organized
society recognizes men's rights, women's rights
and children's rights as equal to money rights.
Buildings owned by Catholics, the different Protestant
denominations, by Jews, both reform and
orthodox, and by free-thinking societies, can all
be secured for the promulgation of these moral
truths, if our workers will divest themselves of
prejudices and don a tactful address. The success
of this plan lies altogether in the judgment, personality
and breadth of mind of the Volunteer
who attempts the task.</p>

<p>When you approach the trustee of a Methodist,
Episcopalian, Catholic or a Jewish church,
remember that the building, the use of which you
ask, has been paid for by contributions given at
a sacrifice by earnest men and women, with
minds turned towards the solemn and higher
things of life. However mixed with ignorance,
superstitious fear or motives of vanity, these
buildings, in the smaller towns and agricultural
communities, are associated with thoughts above
and separated from personal controversies and
material things and, if you can convince those in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
control that you wish to present facts, views and
ideas of a helpful nature to the community, not
incongruous with the teaching of their faith, you
will generally receive an affirmative answer.</p>


<h3>LAY PREACHING.</h3>

<p>It is common in country districts for laymen,
persons neither ordained nor licensed as ministers,
to speak from Christian pulpits at regular
church services. This custom should be utilized.
A lecture in a church building on a week night
may attract the more studious or the more curious
of the community and supply them with rich
materials for right thinking; but a lay sermon to
a regular congregation, backed by the regular
services and the presence of the minister, carries
with it a force and authority possible on no other
occasion. A Volunteer, by reciting, under such
auspices, a simple story of the crimes against God
and humanity perpetrated by the money power,
and describing feelingly the effect of unnecessary
poverty on the souls and characters of men, will
not only stir the congregation to a new sense of
patriotic duty, but will furnish material to the
country minister enabling him to add a new flavor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to the food of his flock for months to come. In
those outlying districts where God has not been
entirely superseded by gold in the church, a large
part of the educational work of our movement can
be accomplished in this way.</p>

<p>The farmers compose a large part of our
country's population and vote. They still believe
in healthful religion and its power to affect human
life. They can best be reached on Sunday and
very often better through the church than in any
other way. The reason that the great cities have
not responded so quickly and so enthusiastically
to our movement as the country districts is that
vice, crime and disease in the great cities have, to
a large extent, eaten away the capacity for appreciating
justice and brotherhood, and destroyed
in a large class the fundamental virtues of courage,
manliness, patriotism and belief in the supremacy
of good. It is to the country, where these virtues
are still fresh and normal, that our movement
must appeal principally. In the city there
are a thousand places of amusement and dissipation
for every idle hour. The boy coming
from school or work, the mechanic after his day's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
labor pass the open saloon, filled with music
and merry-making, the theatre, with its novelties,
laughter and appeals to all the emotions, the
gambler's den, the game tables, the dives and a
hundred other places, always open, some positively
and immediately hurtful to both health and
morals, others absorbing time, attention and vitality.</p>

<p>In the country, however, work or study done,
a man or boy has not so many places of amusement.
There is much more inducement than in
the city to attend some church entertainment,
some healthful neighborhood ball, and much
more time and energy left for meetings at the
school or church for the discussion of social problems
and questions of national or class well-being.</p>

<p>Thus the Volunteer who would teach farmers
and villagers must accept the church as one very
promising field of work.</p>


<h3>SUNDAY WORK.</h3>

<p>No day is more appropriate for effective work
in behalf of human brotherhood than Sunday.
By common consent it has been set aside by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
majority of civilized races for serious thought,
meditation and worship, and what is more befitting
this day than to think out, study out and
talk out the solution to the great problem of
human justice and brotherhood. To speak for
the New Democracy on Sunday is no more than
to gather in the fruit of all the great religions
that have come down to us. The New Democracy
is not religion and those who proclaim its
truths are neither preachers nor priests, but it is
religion's highest product. The great religions
of the world, nurtured by God's hand and growing
out of the fertile and sympathetic souls of
the men and women of all climes and all centuries,
have at last produced a practical ideal capable
of being realized in actual life. This product
is the New Democracy. It is the answer to
the prayers of the ages. It is God's gift granted
in answer to the cries of suffering of injustice and
poverty throughout the world. It is God's
method of redeeming society, of saving our nation,
now well-nigh unto death, from greed and
sin. Let each retain his attachment to his own
sect and religion, but instead of quarreling about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
sectarian differences, let us unite in realizing
our common dreams of brotherhood. Instead of
building new walls to separate us, let us make one
platform so large that on it all earnest sons of
God can stand erect, confident of His presence.</p>

<p>Centuries before Jesus Christ traversed the
plains of Galilee and bathed in the troubled
waters of the Jordan, there was one Buddha who,
despising the superstitions of his time, gathered
about him others who, like him, believed that the
larger part of human suffering was unnecessary
and could be extinguished by human agency.
This band traveled throughout the most populous
districts of Western Asia teaching the great
truth that the object of life's endeavor should be
to lessen pain and to increase joy. Their one
command was "cease causing pain; do not kill or
cause to suffer any man or animal." And within
two hundred years, from this little band and from
this one whole-hearted man, an enthusiasm for
mercy and love and justice overspread a third
of the human race. Buddha's teachings were free
from the multitude of miserable superstitions that
haunt the people who bear his name to-day. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
teachings, with those of Zoroaster, Confucius,
Mencius, Moses and Christ, in their purity, attempted
primarily to induce men to live as
brothers, to teach men that individual good is
social good and that both duty and true happiness
consist in devotion to others&mdash;to the commonwealth.</p>

<p>Some preachers, however, get so in the habit
of prophesying that, when their prophecies are
fulfilled, they think it wicked and heretical to believe
it. They refuse to believe their own eyes
when they see the answer to their prayers. So
deep-rooted has grown their habit of prayer
that the means has become an end. They ask no
longer to get what they ask for but for the exercise
of asking, which they call pious. Their
prayers answered, they are astounded. Now that
their prophecies are fulfilled, they open their unbelieving
eyes in wonderment and condemn those
who stop asking for what is already given.</p>


<h3>DON'T ASK FOR WHAT YOU HAVE.</h3>

<p>Christ many times used the relation of a child
to its father to represent the relation of man to
God. When a boy begs his father for a sleigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and pony, and, after much pleading, the father
grants his request, the boy stops asking, accepts
the gift with thanks and proceeds to take a ride.
If he were to continue on his knees pleading for
them after being told they were in the back yard
subject to his orders, we should call him a simpleton.
What is the use of his saying, "Oh, papa,
please, dear papa, give me a pony and sleigh,"
when papa has already given it and is anxious to
see it driven past the house. If the boy has any
sense at all, upon first seeing his father drive his
new pony toward home, he will stop praying,
take off his hat, throw it up in the air, and hallo a
"Hurrah for pop." He will jump into the sleigh,
go for his best girl, and not show up again till two
o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>For centuries the human race has longed and
prayed and hoped for a time when justice would
be possible on earth, when the reign of brutality
would be superceded by the triumph of justice
and brotherly love. This desire, this deep yearning,
has taken definite expression in the ceremonials
and prayers of all religions, and in the grand
prayer given us by Jesus Christ:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on
earth as it is in Heaven."</p>

<p>The soul of the universe has found expression
in the Divine Hand that guides the course of nations,
and has answered the prayers of the
churches and the heroes and the saints. And that
justice, which for centuries has been an object of
prayer, has become, for the first time in history,
a tangible, definite thing, capable of realization.
What we have asked for, God has made
possible. Why now crawl longer in the dust
like worms beneath the feet of tyrants, when God
bids us rise and stand erect? Why continue to
pray and plead for what God has already placed
within our reach? Tell the preachers to stop
praying for this gift, already ours, and accept it
as God gave it. THIS SIMPLE ACT OF ACCEPTING
GOD'S ANSWER TO THE
PRAYERS OF THE GOOD AND THE
TRUE OF ALL PAST CENTURIES, IS THE
PROGRAM OF THE NEW DEMOCRACY.</p>

<p>I ask father for a horse and sleigh. Now that
he brings it to me, I stop asking for it, and take
a ride. We have prayed during centuries for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
era of justice. The New Democracy is the fulfillment
of God's prophecy. It is the greatest
moral tidal wave that ever thrilled with new life
this old world of ours. It embodies the practical
program by means of which the Infinite Intelligence
is leading humanity to its inheritance.</p>


<h3>HUMANITY'S SCOUTS HAVE FOUND
THE WAY.</h3>

<p>A body of pioneers lose their way in the wilderness.
After days of weary trudging and hunger,
they kneel and pray to God for guidance to food
and shelter. In the midst of their devotions, a
scout returns and rudely interrupts them, crying,
"Get up, boys, stop your prayers; I have found
the main road, and we are only ten miles from
town." What should our pious travelers do?
If they have an ounce of common sense, they will
jump to their feet, brush the dust from their
trousers, and follow their deliverer. Should we
not call them insane, on the other hand, if, accustomed
to hunger and thirst, they had come to
believe prayer and privation the ends of life, and,
if instead of rising up and accepting God's an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>swer
to their prayers, they should continue to
grovel and pray on?</p>

<p>After eighteen centuries of prayer and privation,
of hunger and thirst, the couriers and
scouts of the human race have returned, and to
their kneeling, miserable brothers they cry aloud,
"Arise, cease your prayers for already they have
been answered. We have found the road and
the promised land is near. Hunger and thirst are
no longer necessary. Let thanksgiving and
praise to God now take the place of begging petitions
for that which He hath already granted us."</p>

<p>As true religionists, is it our duty to say to
these scouts, "Stop, you infidels, you interfere
with our devotion?" Such a policy is insanity.
These teachers are not infidels. They are not
enemies of religion. Otherwise God would not
have revealed to them His plan for answering
the prayers of the millions and fulfilling the
prophecies of past ages.</p>

<p>We have been praying: "Lead us aright. Show
us the way to realize Heaven in this world." Humanity
will now stop asking and accept, as a
child from its father, God's last and greatest gift.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
The weary travelers of earth will see that the
privations of centuries are no longer necessary.
They will stop pleading with Heaven for the
manna to be had by simply putting forth their
palms.</p>


<h3>PRISONERS OF THE BASTILE.</h3>

<p>For an explanation of the action of those poor,
irrational creatures who are so accustomed to privation
and prayer that when relief comes they
only continue to pray, failing to recognize that
their prayers are answered, we can only point to
the last poor inmates of the French bastile. The
most prominent and intellectual citizens of France,
they had been torn from their homes without a
trial, thrown into dungeons containing not a single
ray of light, fed there on bread and water from
year to year until lonely and in torture their
hair turned prematurely white and their bodies
withered. When, at the first stroke of that
most glorious of revolutions, the bastile doors
were opened, and the soldiers of the people
broke down the huge iron gates and doors,
crying aloud in the name of liberty, "You are
free, you are free, come out long imprisoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
brothers," the populace were astounded to
find that many of the poor, white-haired, white-bearded,
pale-faced prisoners, instead of walking
out into the long-wished for sunlight, clutched
the walls of their cells, clung to their prison floors
and cried in fear. They had to be torn from
their gloomy haunts by main force by their rescuers.
Their years of trouble, of darkness and
gloom had destroyed their power to enjoy the
light of freedom. Many of the brightest intellects
of France had thus been dimmed. Their souls,
once afire for freedom, had burned out in despair.
They had become maniacs.</p>

<p>So now there are devotees of religion, so inured
to the gloomy slavery of poverty and injustice, so
in the habit of praying for relief, that when the
bold servants of God strike down with their ready
hammers the prison walls, and freedom's air and
sunlight stream in, these poor souls are horrified,
paralyzed by the very light and atmosphere for
which they have been praying. "Go away," they
say, and, crying, they clutch their cell walls
refusing to be free. They, too, have become maniacs.
But the majority of the human race will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
not refuse freedom's balmy breeze or the sunshine
of liberty. At the call of the New Democracy
they will throw down their broken chains
of poverty, leap through their open prison doors,
and cheer with might and main as the majority
of the prisoners of the bastile cheered a century
ago when they were given freedom's light.</p>


<h3>THE COMMANDMENTS GROWN WITH
THE WORLD.</h3>

<p>If men claim that we are to be forever satisfied
with the commands, "Thou shalt not steal," and
"Thou shalt not kill," we will answer that these
commands have grown, and that under the banner
of the New Democracy we shall declare in thunder
tones to all the world, "thou shalt not be
killed," "thou shalt not be robbed," and not only
this but also, "thou shalt not allow thy brethren
to be killed," and, "thou shalt not allow thy
brethren to be robbed." These commands have
developed still further, so that the cry shall go up
from sea to sea that our present and past systems
of thievery, robbery and murder shall be swept
away, that the teaching of the churches against
thievery, robbery and murder, through all the cen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>turies,
has borne fruit, and that now, not only shall
the poor, dependent teachers of abstract truth proclaim
between hymns and prayers, "thou shalt not
steal," and "thou shalt not kill," but that the
whole people shall Join in one mighty chorus,
and declare that public thievery, robbery and
murder must cease from off the earth and that
our social and political systems shall be made to
conform to the teachings of our religion.</p>

<p>To those who oppose us in the name of religion,
let our answer be, "We do not fight the church;
without the church and its teachings for nineteen
centuries, the New Democracy would have been
impossible." The New Democracy is an outgrowth
of all religions. Religion has protected
and kept alive, through the barbarous past, the
great moral truths that we are now applying to
actual life. Even if the church or any part of
the church or priesthood or ministry attempts to
oppose us, we will simply laugh with God at
every futile effort to stem the flood, the source of
which is their own teaching through nineteen centuries.
For the church, or any part of it, to oppose
or belittle or criticise the New Democracy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
is for the tree to disclaim its own fruit, for the
rivers to disown the sea, for the fountain to dry
up its stream, for the mother to cast aside her
child.</p>

<p>The founders and prophets of all the great religions
taught the principles of justice and
brotherly love. The New Democracy makes possible
their realization.</p>

<p>What nobler work can any man engage in on
Sunday than the proclaiming in open air or behind
closed doors these eternal truths, or tell of
the new impulse that is fast taking hold of men to
weave these truths into the texture of our social
institutions.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p class="p6"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
ONLY TWO PARTIES IN THE WORLD.</h2></div>


<p>Another of the few foundation truths upon
which the structure of the world's present
progress is being reared, a truth that cannot be
too often told nor too continuously urged, is that
THERE ARE ONLY TWO PARTIES IN
THE WORLD.</p>

<p>One party consists of those who, seeing wrong,
try to end it; seeing injustice, strive to abolish it;
and, being told of possible improvements, investigate
and EXPERIMENT, hoping to attain
them.</p>

<p>The other party is made up of those who cannot
see wrongs when practiced upon others, who
are blind to injustice for fear of the unjust, and
who, being told of possible improvements, antagonize
their instructors, in defense of the private
interests of themselves or their masters, that
might by change be jeopardized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
One party represents the cause of the people;
the other the selfishness of kings, nobles and plutocrats.</p>

<p>The fight now is not simply a continuation of
the old fight that has been going on from ancient
times, but is the world climax, the end of the
struggle. Those who produce and trade and
teach, earning their money by honorable exertion,
are forming all along the line, against those who
are too lazy to work, too stupid or too proud to
trade or teach, but who wish to grow rich by acquiring
other people's property. The honest
masses who believe in law, order and progress,
are approaching a decisive contest for permanent
supremacy with the dishonest classes who, in
order to defend their systems of plunder, utilize
in their service the combined forces of ignorance,
superstition, toadyism, lawless cunning and the
force of arms.</p>

<p>If the lawless, irresponsible dictators of industry
and commerce are successful, then liberty, constitutional
government and personal security are
at an end, civilization is derailed into an abyss,
and retrogression displaces progress through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
another age of barbarism. Gold becomes the
only God, and bayonets the only prod to duty.
The university, the press and the pulpit will all be
made permanent attachments to the one despotic
machine which is to control every source of communication
and instruction, and stifle all thought
and aspiration that does not strengthen the ruling
power.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the people's victory will end
class rule forever, and gradually abolish all special
privileges and monopolies by means of which
one man holds an unjust advantage over another.
The people holding the reins of power will apply
the best talent, experience and energy possessed
by man to the establishment of justice,
order and public achievement. This is the situation
confronting our country and the world.
It is the situation as it confronts every individual
man. The war is universal. There are no non-combatants.
Everyone is affected by the outcome.
Each has the power to help decide the
result. Whether in compliance with or against
our will, each of us must participate and assist
one side or the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Which shall it be? The party of the people
or the party of tyranny. This question presents
itself alike to the citizen of America and the inhabitant
of Europe. Since the historic people's
victory at Chicago, July 6, 1896, the people's
party in America has taken the name "REGULAR
DEMOCRATIC." In Germany, France
and England it is known as the "Social Democracy;"
in the Balkans and Asia Minor it is the
"Greek;" and in the West Indies, the "Cuban
Army."</p>

<p>When once the masses realize that the same
class of adventurers, tax-gatherers and oppressors
of labor who in this country have gotten
absolute control of the Republican political
machine, are the present friends, the advisers and
colleagues of the despots, plutocrats and military
leaders of Europe, that their families are intermarrying,
their interests being pooled, their cause becoming
one, their interests identical, all their
plans and hopes one and inseparable, then will
it be impossible for designing demagogues to mislead
or confuse them further. When it becomes
generally understood that the forces of reaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
throughout the world are one, then will the common
people come into closer union and bind
themselves together as a unit.</p>

<p>The union of those who profit by tyranny necessitates
the union of all who believe in liberty.
The internationalism of millionaires is creating
an internationalism of the common people. The
situation is being so simplified that all may comprehend
clearly the two forces whose conflict
extends over the modern world. All minor and
secondary divisions and issues are swallowed up.
The international aspect of the problem does not,
as one might at first suppose, confuse the mind,
but, on the other hand, simplifies the issue so
that none can mistake concerning it. Old prejudices,
reverence for party names, sectional hatreds,
sores left by historic feuds, religious differences
and affiliations with local political machines, in
which self or friends are interested selfishly, all
tend to cover up the real issues, when only the
local end of the fight is studied.</p>

<p>But, when we learn that the same class that
induced the governments of Europe and America
to co-operate with Spanish murderers in starving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
killing and torturing tens of thousands of our
patriotic brother Americans in Cuba to protect
the value of their Spanish bonds and got these
so-called Christian governments to assist the
Turk, supply him with arms and drill and general
his soldiers for the massacre of hundreds of thousands
of defenseless Armenians and Greeks, to
secure the continued payment of interest on their
Turkish bonds; that this class is made up of the
same individual bondholders who are gaining
control, through syndicates, of our American
breweries, distilleries, railroads, street car companies,
gas companies and other manufacturing
and commercial institutions; that they are ever
ready mercilessly and barbarously, by murder
or giant fraud, to advance their interests, regardless
of duty to humanity, country or to God, all of
which they deny; and, when we prove that this
class now controls absolutely the machinery of the
Republican party in America, and is trying again
to control Democracy, the masses, in their fury
against it will, regardless of historic prejudices
or past or local political affiliations, unite in common
defense of home and country to stamp it
out.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE PARTY OF EXPERIMENT.</h3>

<p>Our enemies say ours is a party of EXPERIMENT.
We admit it. No forward step in the
world's history, no achievement in science, art,
literature or politics has ever come but by EXPERIMENT.</p>

<p>We are not, however, the only party of EXPERIMENT.
The plutocrats, who now control
our country, also believe in EXPERIMENT,
only their experiments are in the direction of further
despoiling the people without adding to popular
rage, and of tightening their grip upon our
property, our lives and liberties without inciting
to rebellion.</p>

<p>One man experiments with surgeon's knife
upon the body of another, chloroformed or a
corpse. But suppose the chloroform ceases to
act or the corpse proves a case of suspended animation,
rises up snatches the surgical
instrument, ties his tormentor to the couch and
begins to experiment on him. The EXPERIMENT
in either case may be equally beneficial to
science, equally dangerous to the victim. But
the personal value of the EXPERIMENT to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
either of the principals depends, in a large
measure, upon WHETHER HE IS THE EXPERIMENTER
OR THE MAN EXPERIMENTED
ON.</p>

<p>The millionaires united are at present experimenting
on the people. The records of their discoveries
are doubtless of great value to political
science but when the unfortunate public, heretofore
thought dead or safely hypnotized, arises and
with ghastly alacrity, begins to EXPERIMENT
on its doctors, not only will science be equally
benefited, but the "corpse" will enjoy the operation
hugely.</p>

<p>This outcry on the part of the plutocrats against
political experimenting means simply that <i>they
want to do all the experimenting themselves</i>.</p>


<h3>OUR ENEMIES ARE THE INNOVATORS.</h3>

<p>A family, sheltered for many years to their entire
satisfaction by an old homestead, that also
protected their property, suddenly discovers that
their silverware is fast disappearing with many
heirlooms, jewels and valuable papers and
pieces of furniture. They discuss a plan for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
changing the locks and, with the aid of a skilled
mechanic, make an examination of every wall,
floor, door and window with a view to a general
overhauling and repairs. A neighbor makes serious
objection and in a solemn manner appeals
to his friends not to interfere with the ancient
landmarks nor lay an irreverent hand upon the
old homestead, that served their father so well
and that sheltered them and protected their property
so long. His only object in thus warning his
friend against dangerous innovation being grateful
reverence for which has been so useful in the
past.</p>

<p>Supposing the owner to be possessed of common
sense, his answer will be: "Yes, my friend, the
old homestead has served me and my fathers
well for a long period of years and I had never
intended to irreverently destroy it. But I have discovered
that some stranger has already laid an
irreverent hand upon our home and broken the
locks of our doors and windows. We find that
he has cut a hole in the floor of our side closet and
effected entrances through the roof and the cellar
window. The home which once protected us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
serves no longer as a protection, because mutilated
by an intruder. If the house still protected
us as it did our fathers we should be satisfied;
but, since others have changed it, we, in self-protection,
must adapt ourselves to the changed
conditions. It is not the old house that protected
our fathers that we are changing, but the new
house, the changed house, the mutilated house&mdash;this
it is that we wish to renovate and re-adapt,
so that it may again be made to serve us as did the
old one. The same outside framework, the
same old flag-pole, brown front and corner stone
remain, but many of the foundation stones are
gone, the strength of the house, its power to
serve and protect us have been taken away so
that we are in constant fear of its caving in upon
us. Therefore, we shall repair it thoroughly or
else remove to another."</p>

<p>Our government for many years served the
people well. Its past is sacred. It protected our
fathers, made our lives and our fortunes possible
and we are tempted to give weight to the arguments
of a compatriot when he says to us:
"Touch not the ancient landmarks; do not lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
irreverent hands on our government; do not seek
to change its laws or institutions; it has served us
well and we should show our gratitude by protecting
it and by opposing innovation."</p>

<p>In answer, however, we are forced to say that,
although we have the same flag-pole and flag, the
same brown front and corner stone, an enemy has
for years been removing one foundation stone
after another. He has removed the vital parts
from the locks of our doors and windows; made
entrances through the roof, the floor and cellar,
so that our silver is now disappearing, our jewels
and our heirlooms are missing, and our liberty, our
lives and our property are in danger.</p>

<p>WE ARE NOT THE INNOVATORS. WE
ARE THE VICTIMS OF INNOVATION.
We seek to battle against the invaders who have
mutilated our government and would destroy us.
We strive to make our government, of which
now only the shell remains, serve us as it served
our forefathers, capable of affording us that shelter
and protection, which is the true function of
government, and which our forefathers intended
we should have.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>


<h3>TWO GOVERNMENTS IN MORTAL COMBAT.</h3>

<p>We have two distinct governments in our
country, whose interests are antagonistic and irreconcilable.
One government is the United States;
the other, the United Trusts and Syndicates. The
former is democratic; the other despotic. This
inner-treasonable despotism controls our industry,
commerce and means of life and pleasure. It is
using the United States government as a machine
to enforce its decrees and extend its dominion,
hoping soon to abolish the last vestige of popular
rule. It is world-wide in its extent, and only
uses local and national governments as means of
power.</p>

<p>The United States enacts laws openly. The
United trusts and syndicates enacts laws
secretly. Disobedience to our state laws is punished
only after a public trial, but the merchant
who breaks a trust law is ruined without a trial,
the laborer who ignores it is secretly blacklisted;
the minister who defies it is forced out of the
church, and the lawyer disregarding it loses his
profitable practice. The nation enacts a law and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the trust officers laugh at it so far as it applies to
them, and then, by gaining control of the law-enforcing
power, use this law as an additional club
in the subjugation of their victims.</p>

<p>When the people attempt to defeat a new aggression
on the part of the trusts by carrying out
the plan of some renowned thinker, known to be
uninfluenced by special interests, the emissaries
of the trusts scatter the people by crying: "EXPERIMENT."
"An untried and Utopian
scheme," "Innovators." While the patriots argue
as to whether their plan is really an EXPERIMENT,
the enemy captures a new position.</p>

<p>The United Trusts and Syndicates, by experimenting
constantly and pushing forward all along
the line and at the same time by convincing the
United States not to EXPERIMENT, succeeds
in approaching the same relation to its rival government
that a live ant sustains to a dead worm.
By incessant and fearless activity, and by using
our constitution, traditions and flag as a blind, this
irresponsible despotism is fast nearing the time
when it hopes to throw off its mask and publicly
usurp supreme power. Not a day passes but these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
organized conspirators try some new EXPERIMENT,
attempt some new aggression never
dared before, attack some nearer outpost of the
people's liberties heretofore thought impregnable.</p>

<p>Often these EXPERIMENTS fail. The people
are sometimes bull-headed, and repulse the attack
with loss to the United Trusts and Syndicates.
But failing once, twice or a hundred times, do
they cease to EXPERIMENT? Even though
they lose millions in attempting some audacious
act, do they therefore refuse to attempt another act
equally bold? Never. They see clearly that all
enterprise, all progress, all victory, all increase in
power and dominion, result only from repeated
EXPERIMENTS. The boldest of all EXPERIMENTS
was the hatching of the conspiracy that
gave their present organization birth. EXPERIMENT
gave them all they have. They live and
grow by it. To stop EXPERIMENT is to stop
action, for the modern world is a new world and
in it there are no tried and beaten paths. The
floods and glaciers of innovation have carried
away the ancient landmarks, and by raising new
barriers and structures largely shut off from all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
progressive peoples, even the kindly rays from the
lamp of experience. Not agitators, but science
and invention, have pushed us away from the ancient
world, with its well-worn roads and lighthouses,
and where we walk now human feet never
trod before. The light from our foreheads is
our only lamp, and eternal truth our only guide,
prefer to EXPERIMENT, OR TO BE EXPERIMENTED
ON; TO BE THE SURGEON, OR
THE CORPSE.</p>

<p>The Democratic party in power in 1900 controlled
by the common people will, without doubt,
EXPERIMENT boldly. It will lead our government
into new and untried ways, as our enemies
very clearly and very truthfully predict. It will,
without doubt, commit blunders and make mistakes.
The one thing that above all and in spite
of all it is pledged to do, is to arouse the United
States government from its paralysis, stupor and
corpse-like state of being experimented on, and
declare that whatever the EXPERIMENTS of
the future, instead of being made ON THE
UNITED STATES, THEY SHALL BE
MADE BY THE UNITED STATES.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
The important question for the citizens of the
United States to answer is simply this: Do you
prefer to EXPERIMENT, or to be experimented
on; to be the surgeon, or the corpse?</p>

<p>When the victimized people declare their independence,
through their own government, of the
despotism of the trusts, it will necessarily be an
EXPERIMENT.</p>

<p>Every time General Grant ordered an attack on
the forces defending negro slavery, he tried an
EXPERIMENT. Never could he tell exactly
what the result would be. There might be more
dead Union men than Confederates, or there
might possibly be more dead Confederates than
Union men. The one thing of which he was certain,
however, was that his duty consisted in going
ahead, and, when defeated, he gathered his
troops together and tried again. He knew that,
if followed long enough, his plan would crush the
Confederacy.</p>

<p>So each attack on the white slave power to-day
is an EXPERIMENT. We cannot at any time
foretell the immediate result. An attack on a
special monopoly may fail. Many times we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
be repulsed with loss, but by constantly renewing
the attack and continuing to press forward we
shall eventually triumph. During the late war,
the southern states defended black slavery. They
lost. Black slavery was abolished. To-day, the
southern states, dominated by the common people,
have espoused the cause of liberty and to the
oppressors of the North and East they say,
"White slavery also must be destroyed."</p>

<p>Both parties are parties of EXPERIMENT.
The only difference is that we avow ours openly
and write them in our platform, while the experiments
and aggressions of the Republican party
are planned in secret and executed in dark corners
where only traitors and adventurers are allowed
admittance.</p>

<p>To hesitate and refuse to EXPERIMENT is to
tie our hands and remain inactive, while our enemies
harass us, rob us, and assault us from all
directions. It is as important to weaken the
enemy as it is to strengthen your own forces.
Therefore, when by an extensive literature the
money-power instill in the people a horror of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
EXPERIMENT, they palsy their limbs and incapacitate
them for defense.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Democratic Volunteers will
frankly admit the charge that they favor EXPERIMENT
and will boldly proclaim that
EXPERIMENT is one of the foundation stones
of their creed. By ceaseless and tireless repetition
in every community of our nation we will ask
the people to begin to EXPERIMENT on their
own account, instead of permitting EXPERIMENT
to longer remain a monopoly in the hands
of those who continually decry it. We will ask
them to decide whether they will longer remain
objects of EXPERIMENT, or, by government
action, begin to EXPERIMENT on their persecutors.</p>

WITNESSES FOR PLUTOCRACY DISCREDITED.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></h2></div>


<p>When the nature of the present world conflict
is understood, those who favor the people's cause
will cease to receive any further instruction or
advice whatever from their enemies or the allies
or agents of their enemies.</p>

<p>If America declared open war upon Britain
should we put the slightest confidence in any
statement, emanating from English sources as to
the best line of attack? And, if a coterie of young
Britishers were to enter our camp and advise our
soldiers to open fire in a northward direction,
should we not rather suspect an attack from the
enemy on the south? Is it not a rule in war always
to fire in the direction opposite to that advised
by your enemies? In all business and other
practical affairs of life is it not universally recog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>nized
as the extreme of folly to accept as facts
the statements of those who may profit by our discomfiture?</p>

<p>Most assuredly! And it is time for the merchants
and workingmen of America to apply to
their political struggle these simple maxims so
well established elsewhere.</p>


<h3>WORTHLESS TESTIMONY.</h3>

<p>Imagine a courtroom filled with spectators and
a group of culprits being tried for wholesale theft.
The strongest evidence has been produced by
both the prosecution and defense and the result
is in doubt. Anxious crowds are waiting in suspense
for some decisive stroke that shall give an
advantage to one side or the other. The counsel
for the defense arises and plays his last card by an
eloquent appeal in behalf of the prisoners, basing
his plea entirely on the superiority of his witnesses.
He shows that they stand much higher
in the community than the witnesses for the prosecution,
who are poor, untutored countrymen.
"My witnesses," says he, "include the leading men
in your community&mdash;your parson, the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of your high school, and the editor of your paper.
Yours are mere yahoos and ignoramuses, not capable
of exercising judgment in such a case as
this." A murmur of assent passes around the
room. There is a cheer of confirmation, and the
jurors nod their heads significantly.</p>

<p>The prosecuting attorney, instead of making a
speech, plays his last card by taking the jury to
the stable, where they discover that the horse on
which the teacher rode to court is one of those
stolen from Farmer Hayseed's stable, and further
he proves that the suit of clothes worn by the
parson on the witness stand was made of the very
piece of woolen goods taken from the country
storekeeper, and that the coins that fill the purse
of the respected editor are the same identical
marked coins accumulated by Widow Jones for
her old age and taken from her money drawer on
the night of the crime in question. No speeches,
no arguments are necessary after this. The
jurors purge their memories of the testimony for
the defense, and the culprits are sent to prison.</p>

<p>In the great case of "The People versus Monopoly,"
now being tried at the bar of Public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Opinion, the defense, beaten upon every other
point, bases its last plea upon the superiority of
its witnesses. It is claimed that the authorities on
finance, the press and the pulpit are witnesses
in defense of Monopoly. We acknowledge this,
and in answer wish only to take the jury, who are
to decide this case, to the homes of these witnesses,
where they can see for themselves that
they are sharers in the plunder that has been taken
from the plaintiffs.</p>


<h3>THE PRESS.</h3>

<p>The first important witness in behalf of the defense
is the great metropolitan press, the peculiar
and special product of the dying years of the
present century.</p>

<p>Now, the modern newspaper is a corporation,
formed for the one purpose of paying dividends
to stockholders. In order to make money it must
serve the people who have money, for now all the
profits of the great dailies are derived from the
sale of space in their columns, the receipts for the
sale of papers not covering expenses. The business
manager, with a few exceptions, controls the
editorial department and dictates all policies. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
we poor wayfarers, hungry for information concerning
some important interest, seize upon a
learned editorial in a great metropolitan daily, and
while we think we are being instructed by the
weighty opinion of some friendly and scholarly
writer, we are in fact reading THE PAID ADVERTISEMENT
of our enemies, placed in the
paper to confuse us. When, in the news department,
we read a speech or an interview, it is often
so garbled that the meaning is quite changed.
And what we consider to be a simple statement of
fact is often a doctored narrative, containing fictitious
figures, and printed for the sole purpose of
misleading the public.</p>

<p>The attempt of the gold press to array the agricultural
producers against the city laborers, and
the mechanics against the agriculturists is cruel
and deliberate. And this power to deceive and
mislead carries with it the power of life or death.</p>

<p>Suppose I were to go to Mr. Jones and tell him
that Mr. Smith had declared to me that he was
going to shoot him on sight, and that I had seen
him purchase a revolver for that purpose; and
then I should go to Mr. Smith and tell him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
his friend Jones had just armed himself to the
teeth for the purpose of killing him, stating that I
had heard him swear and curse and declare before
heaven that Smith should not live another
day. Now, suppose these two neighbors, heretofore
warm friends, were to approach each other,
and Smith, as a precaution, would reach his hand
toward his hip-pocket, and Jones, in order to save
his life, would pull out his weapon and fire, both
men shooting each other at the same time.</p>

<p>The result would be TWO DEAD FOOLS,
the victims of ONE LIVE LIAR.</p>

<p>The power to deceive great masses of people by
simultaneous and premeditated conspiracy on the
part of the papers owned by monopoly, carries
with it the power to weaken the masses by dividing
them in a struggle over false issues; and while
they fight among themselves, to rob them and
legislate their children into slavery.</p>

<p>Here are the words of the great journalist, John
Swinton, before the New York Press Association,
in response to a toast, "The Independent Press:"</p>

<p class="p2 i2">"There is no such thing in America as an independent
Press, unless it is in the country towns. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
know it and I know it. There is not one of you
who dare express an honest opinion; if you express it,
you know beforehand that it would never appear in
print. I am paid one hundred and fifty dollars a
week for keeping my honest opinions out of the paper
I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar
salaries for similar things. If I should permit honest
opinions to be printed in one issue of my paper, like
Othello, before twenty-four hours my occupation
would be gone. Any man who would be so foolish
as to write honest opinions would be out on the street
hunting for another job. The business of the New
York journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie outright,
to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon,
and to sell his country and race for his daily bread,
or for about the same thing&mdash;his salary. You know
this, and I know it; and what foolery to be toasting
an 'Independent Press.' We are tools and the vassals
of rich men behind the scenes. We are jumping
jacks; they pull the strings and we dance. Our time,
our talents, our lives, our possibilities, all are property
of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes."</p>

<p class="p2">In the case of "The American People versus
the Banks and Trusts," we have found, by personal
examination, as also by the confession of a
member of the family, John Swinton, that the
money which inflates the purse of the prominent
editorial witness consists of the marked coins that
made up a portion of the booty in question. No
sane juror will believe the testimony of such a
witness.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>


<h3>CLERGY NEEDS SYMPATHY, NOT BLAME.</h3>

<p>It is also claimed that God's ministry has
offered its testimony in behalf of the defense. It
is not my purpose to say anything against the
clergy, because if there is an abused and ill-treated
class of men on the face of the earth to-day, who
need pity and prayer and succor, it is the men
who have dedicated their lives to the Christ who
was killed by the rich of His time, and who are
now dependent for their living, their children's
food and their wives' clothing, upon the blended
piety and pride, the virtues and vanities of the rich
of to-day.</p>

<p>In all that inconsistent barbarism, which we call
civilization, there is no man who needs sympathy
so much and deserves blame so little as he who
is attempting at the same time to preach for God
and to get his living from God's enemies, to build
monuments to the Christ who lived and died for
the poor, and gain the material and cost of these
monuments by flattering those who are grinding
the faces of the poor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Many clergymen have told me how their hearts
have bled for the victims of social injustice; how
in anguish they have wept over the piteous cries
for help uttered by their dying brothers and sisters
in Jesus Christ; how, bursting with indignation,
they have longed to strike a blow against the
brutality that crushes Christ's little ones in order
to grind from their bones and blood colossal and
unnatural fortunes. But they said, "We must
conceal our tears and swallow our indignation,
though it chokes us. We dare not speak out&mdash;we
could neither destroy the tyrant nor save the
victims. We would only succeed in dragging
down our own wives and little ones into that dark
stream of poverty, from which those who have
once fallen in can never hope to rise. First of all,
we must live&mdash;and then do what little we can
to temper the reign of injustice and oppression.
The overthrow and destruction of this system of
injustice rests upon the shoulders of God and the
common people."</p>

<p>I would ask the workmen of the country who
are rapidly leaving the churches not to judge the
clergy harshly, because the majority are dumb in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
your behalf and because a few openly and blatantly
champion the cause of the oppressors.</p>

<p>But I must also ask you to place no confidence
in their testimony in this political trial, for
their lips often utter words their hearts fain would
withhold, and they often pray for success to the
banner for which they cannot fight.</p>

<p>Let us not condemn them because they are
bound with chains of dependence, but let us
rather include them among those whom we shall
liberate when we establish a POLITICAL SYSTEM
WHICH SHALL SET ALL MEN
FREE.</p>

<p>In the case of "The American People versus the
Money Lending and Bondholding Class," we
find that the long, flowing garb of the ministerial
witness, that at first inspired our confidence in his
testimony, because of the holy office it suggested,
is made of the very cloth, a part of the plunder,
the disapperance of which is the basis of the present
trial. The testimony of such a witness, cajoled,
terrorized, and a sharer in the booty taken,
is also without value.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE TESTIMONY OF THE COLLEGE AUTHORITIES.</h3>

<p>Now, as to the college professors: From the
earliest times down to the present day, learning
has been fostered, patronized and supported by
wealth. The kings and nobility of various times
and nations, too stupid or lazy to acquire distinction
in the field of scholarship themselves, have
vied with each other in gathering around them
the greatest scholars, musicians, poets and minstrels,
as well as the greatest athletes, the most
beautiful and voluptuous women, the fastest
horses, and the most interesting curios of every
description. Some of the patrons of learning and
art have been really serious in their devotion to
the beautiful and true. It is, perhaps, one of the
greatest encomiums that we can pronounce upon
the wealth of the world, that in all ages it has
supported learning as the stalk supports the
flower. This condition of affairs has not existed,
however, without causing an undesirable dependence
on the part of the beneficiaries.</p>

<p>Who has passed through the great art galleries
of the Louvre at Paris, and beheld the acres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of canvas, covered with the work of the immortal
Rubens, without being filled with anger and disgust
as he thought of the genius and years of toil
which, instead of being devoted to conceiving and
executing new masterpieces to delight and inspire
all future ages, were applied to daubing the vain
and cruel countenance and the unattractive person
of the patroness who gave him his bread?</p>

<p>The first and greatest universities in this land
were founded, have been built up, and are at
present supported by the bequests and donations,
the gratuitous contributions of the rich. The
vast undying benefits that have flowed from this
wealth, which have been devoted to learning,
ancient and modern, cannot easily be overestimated.
What the world would have been without
the enlightenment which has come from this
source it is not easy to imagine. We should hold
in high esteem the solitary student who, in past
ages and to-day, gropes his silent, difficult way
towards those hidden truths in science, in history
or in art which will one day enlighten and beautify
the world. We should be lovers of all that is
beautiful, and all that is true, and all that is lov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>able
in this great world of ours. Music, painting
and sculpture, the sciences, literature and history,
should be to all sources both of inspiration and of
light. With all our hearts let us welcome these
products of man's talent and genius.</p>

<p>The historian is the hinge linking the present to
the past. His office is not only a useful, but a
sacred one. Scholarship is like womanhood&mdash;one
of the most holy and sacred things in the
world. But, like womanhood, when prostituted,
it becomes the most debased. He who muddies
with error and personal prejudice the fountain of
pure truth is an enemy to his race. But let us
not attempt to blame nor censure individuals.
We know that wealth has been the friend of
learning; that in all times past those who have
devoted their time to the pursuit of truth or
beauty have been dependent upon the support of
the rich and powerful. You say that if wealth
has been the friend of learning, it is only natural
that learning should be the friend of wealth.
Yes, this is exactly the fact in the case. Learning
is the friend of wealth for two reasons:
One, because she feels grateful for past favors;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the other, and greater, because she is hopeful for
favors to come.</p>

<p>It is well known in educational circles that any
college found propagating "heresies" like "free
silver" or "government ownership of the railroads"&mdash;in
other words, any institution which
does not distort and curtail its teachings so as to
bias the student in favor of the single gold standard
and the eternal reign of monopoly&mdash;will be
cut off without a dollar by plutocracy and doomed
to a future of comparative impotence and uselessness
for lack of funds.</p>


<h3>THE RESULT.</h3>

<p>What is the result? The president of a large
private university, knowing that his reputation
for success or failure depends upon the growth of
his university as compared with that of neighboring
universities, continually trims his sails to secure
favors of those who have money to dispense.
It is a common thing for a college president to
make what he calls a "begging tour." He endeavors
to show to those who are supposed to
have money to bestow that his university is in
great need, and can make the best possible use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of "sound" money in propagating "sound ideas."</p>

<p>A good illustration of this is the tour which
Brooker Washington, the famous colored orator,
the President of the Tuskegee Institute, made
in 1896, through the North and East. He is a
man of intellectual power. He is, no doubt, thoroughly
devoted to the enlightenment of his race;
but the way he flatters and cajoles the rich, advocates
the gold standard, overlooks and keeps
silent about their corruption and crimes, and assents
to their plans for further aggrandizement, is
a lesson which every patriot can study with
profit. He has become a pet and fad among the
wealthy classes of New York and New England.
Even Harvard in 1896 conferred upon him an
honorary degree. He has doubtless gotten heavy
endowments for his college, but he has had to
fawn and flatter and stultify his manhood to do it.
And he has given a striking example of what almost
every college president must do to a greater
or less extent.</p>

<p>The fact is, that PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES,
DEPENDING AS THEY DO UPON
THE CHARITY AND CONSCIENCE<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
MONEY OF THE RICH FOR SUPPORT
AND GROWTH, LIKE ALL THOSE WHO
LIVE BY CHARITY, HAVE ACQUIRED
THE FAWNING SPIRIT OF SERVITUDE
AND DEPENDENCE, AND FAITHFULLY
LICK THE HAND THAT FEEDS THEM.
"Verily the ox knoweth his master's crib."</p>

<p>Many college presidents dare not use any but
"orthodox" gold standard text-books, and professors
who dissent from the views of these books
are forced to swallow their own opinions and
propagate error.</p>

<p>Many of "our great authorities" are mere sycophants
of wealth, creatures of the millionaire,
placed by him in the same category as his musician,
his ballet dancer or chaplain, all valuable
dependents. The money lord of creation often
builds the college (Chicago University, for example),
places the poor book-worm in the position
that makes him a "recognized authority," and the
"authority" must dish up statistics as a cook
dishes up his delicacies to suit the taste of his
master. If he refuses he loses his job, and is no
longer a "recognized authority."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Young men are not only taught in many instances
that the rights of monopoly and money
are more sacred than the rights of men and
women, but are shown frequently that if they
want to make a success in life, and be an honor to
their family and their college they must ally
themselves with the powerful corporations and
trusts and keep their skirts clear of all popular
and reform movements.</p>

<p>The recent action of the Yale students who
brutally attempted to insult the honored guest of
their city, Mr. Wm. J. Bryan, is not without significance.</p>

<p>The authorities and the respectable element
among the students were no doubt, deeply humiliated
by such a disgrace. Yet it is fairly plain that
the dogmatic, uncharitable and violent opposition
to Free Silver indulged in by the professors, has
contributed its part toward causing this exhibition
of anarchy and puppyism.</p>

<p>There is a wide distinction however, between
professors and professors.</p>

<p>There are numerous truly great men who are
aristocrats at heart, who love luxury and culture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and refinement, whose friends are principally
among the rich, whose sympathies are with the
rich, and whose interests in life are bound up with
the prosperity of the wealthy classes. These men
oppose popular rights as conscientiously as did
the old Feudal Lords. They all oppose the New
Democracy.</p>

<p>There are many others&mdash;men of splendid intellect,
but utterly without principle&mdash;who are mere
dishonest, mercenary tools of the highest bidder,
willing to distort and manufacture history, tamper
with statistics, and lie like "shyster lawyers."</p>

<p>As, for instance, the learned professor of the
Chicago University, who declared with brazen
effrontery that whatever might be charged against
Mr. Rockefeller of the Standard Oil Trust, no one
could say that he had accumulated his millions
in any way that interfered with the accumulations
of others.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Again there are a few university "authorities"
who, at the risk of their living and the success of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the institutions they represent, have told the truth
fearlessly. They oppose monopoly and the gold
standard. But their testimony is buried beneath
the overwhelming mass of prejudice, sophistry
and misinformation supplied by their colleagues.</p>

<p>Very distinct from any of these classes is that
swarm of cowardly pusillanimous book-worms,
who, as underlings in the large universities, and as
full-fledged professors in the small colleges, retail
at second-hand with stupid pertinacity and
pig-headed bitterness, all the errors of the "authorities,"
together with new ones of their own special
brew.</p>

<p>It is by the prejudiced and purchased testimony
of such men as these that the monopolies of the
country try to prove that empty stomachs are full,
bare backs clothed, and that a constantly growing
and appreciating dollar is an honest one. It
is with such untrustworthy witnesses that they attempt
to prove to us that the men who have stolen
our property are more honest than we.</p>

<p>The teacher witness for the defense may be
more "respectable and learned" than the witnesses
of the prosecution, but when we see that the uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>versities
are built and professors' salaries paid
from the booty wrung from the people&mdash;in other
words, "that the teacher rides to court on one of
the very horses taken from Farmer Hayseed's
stable" it does not take us long to decide that this
testimony is misleading and false.</p>

<p>Therefore, the workmen, merchants and tax-payers
who compose the jury, which is to hand in
its verdict in 1900, must refuse to consider the
testimony of these collegiate, pulpit and editorial
witnesses, who are proven to be sharers in the
tribute forced from the people by that gigantic
and almost sublime system of world exploitation
carried on scientifically and persistently by those
powerful "trusts" which have cornered the world's
gold and monopolized nearly every necessity and
comfort of life.</p>

<p>The pivotal point in this campaign is the question
of the reliability of witnesses. Not only do
opinions differ, but the history, statistics, and
facts, advanced by the defenders of monopoly and
the gold standard contradict the history, statistics
and facts discovered by the champions of the
people. There can be only one truthful history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the crime of seventy-three, and the seventy-three
other crimes of the shirkers against the workers.
Figures do not lie. Only one set of statistics, as
to the rise in the value of the gold dollar, can possibly
be correct. Facts do not conflict. When
men contradict each other upon a question of fact,
one side is wrong.</p>

<p>Whose history and statistics are we to believe
in this campaign?</p>

<p>Are we to believe the interested, prejudiced,
purchased witnesses of corrupt wealth, or are we
to believe the testimony of the witnesses of the
people&mdash;men who have sacrificed and suffered in
order to tell the truth.</p>

<p>It is because the classes who have the advantages
of culture and leisure, always care more for
their own comforts than for truth and justice, that
these problems, my reader, must be worked out,
by the millions made of the same identical common
mud that you and I are.</p>

<p>As William E. Gladstone has said, all the reforms
brought about in England during the last
century, and of which all her citizens now boast,
"were at first merely impossible ideals in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
minds of the ignorant and fanatical poor," and
were carried through by the working people "in
opposition to the cultured and leisure class."</p>

<p>It is because those who possess the power and
the learning to lead mankind aright have always
proven recreant to the trust imposed upon them,
that God, in directing the course of human history,
has invariably swept this class aside and accepted
as His instruments the poor, the simple-minded
and uncorrupted. From the birth of the
primitive church among the poor fishermen of
Galilee to the abolition of chattel slavery by an
agitation instituted by social and political outcasts,
the hand of God moving in the world has
invariably brushed aside the rich and powerful
with the intellectual parasites that swarm about
them, and in building nations, religions, or instituting
great reforms, has uniformly chosen the
normal, healthy material at the base of society still
uncorrupted by luxury.</p>

VOTE YOURSELVES RICH.</h2></div>


<p>Those who have been voted rich, not by their
own votes, but by our votes, the votes of the
common people, are now engaged in proving to
us THAT WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY
DONE FOR THEM WE CAN BY NO POSSIBLE
MEANS DO FOR OURSELVES.</p>

<p>Having accumulated immense fortunes by
means of vote enacted legislation, THEY
PREACH TO US THE UTTER FOLLY OF
OUR HOPING FOR ANY GAIN FROM
THE SAME SOURCE.</p>

<p>So interested are they in our proper economic
education, that they are willing to supply both
text-books and teachers. They love learning and
from purely philanthropic motives seek to make
us wise.</p>

<p>But what is their wisdom so willingly imparted?
From what follies are they so anxious to guard
us?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
TO VOTE OUR ENEMIES RICH: THIS
IS WISDOM.</p>

<p>TO ATTEMPT TO VOTE OURSELVES
RICH: DANGEROUS FOLLY.</p>

<p>Their science teaches that IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
FOR THE INSTRUMENT WHICH
IS THE SOURCE OF THEIR WEALTH TO
BE OF ANY EFFECT IN BEHALF OF
THOSE WHO WIELD THE INSTRUMENT.</p>

<p>Text-book in hand they say to the people, "It
is impossible for you to vote yourselves rich."</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, it is unnecessary for the people
to "vote themselves rich." WE, THE PEOPLE,
ARE ALREADY RICH. We are rich by
the gift of nature and the will of God. Each
scientific discovery and invention, wrung by toil,
genius and martyrdom from the strange earth
and firmament that greeted primeval man, has
added to our riches. We are now rich, but are
debarred by force from the possession of our own.
We are heirs, not only to the riches of the earth
as originally created, but to all those opportunities
for utilizing these natural treasures, resulting
from the accumulated knowledge and skill of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
centuries. But we are kept from our inheritance.</p>

<p>We have been deprived of our wealth by vote-enacted
legislation, and it is vote-enacted legislation
that will again give us possession.</p>

<p>Our enemies say contemptuously that government
can no more increase wages by legislation
than it can increase the size of your foot or the
length of your arm, for the increase or decrease in
both cases is governed wholly by natural law.</p>

<p>"Let the poor," they say, "stop agitating and
hoping to become prosperous through legislation,
and instead let every man go to work building
his own home and fortune, and all will be
well."</p>

<p>"The Government cannot legislate a single dollar
into existence."</p>

<p>"The remedies for poverty are industry, frugality
and temperance."</p>

<p>These are the things they say. But suppose
we watch their acts instead of listening to their
words. Then we learn that, while for us they
point in one direction to the road that leads to
fortune they seek this road themselves by going
the opposite way. We, who have followed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
advice, have been impoverished; they, who imitated
their acts, have been enriched.</p>


<h3>POTATOES AND POLITICAL ECONOMY.</h3>

<p>I ride to market with a load of potatoes, the result
of sweat and labor for half a year. A ruffian
knocks me off my wagon, takes my seat and
drives away.</p>

<p>Questions: Shall I ask a policeman to help me
catch the despoiler, or shall I "cease agitating and
go to work?" Shall I arm myself and, with the
help of friends, take back my own, or shall I
return to the farm and "practice industry, frugality
and temperance?" Is it nobler, manlier,
more courageous of me to get possession of my
potatoes by fighting, or, forsaking them, to go to
work and raise another crop for the next thief?</p>

<p>Honest and contented labor under these circumstances
is dishonorable.</p>

<p>WHEN A MAN IS ROBBED, THE WAY
FOR HIM TO GET MONEY IS NOT TO
WORK FOR IT BUT TO FIGHT FOR IT.
To tell a man that he cannot possibly make any
money by talking nor get any potatoes by agitating
police officers is absolutely true, PRO<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>VIDED,
the man has been loafing all year and
has not been robbed of his crop. But these demonstrations
of the economists go into the waste
basket, when the fact is made plain that the man,
seeking by government aid to get potatoes, has
already earned them by hard labor, but is deprived
of them by the criminal act of another.
Under such circumstances, the man who, instead
of fighting and pursuing, applies himself to honest
toil, is a coward.</p>

<p>Men who, wrongfully deprived of their property,
go to work to earn more, thus providing
additional booty for their despoilers, are unworthy
a better fate. Honor impels a true man to fight,
not work, when a wrong is suffered either by
himself or friends.</p>

<p>To quietly plow while another eats the result
of last year's plowing, to contentedly plant while
another reaps, to submissively bow one's head
beneath a yoke and receive the kicks and jeers
and sneers of the drivers, are not the acts of a
man nor the duties of a citizen, but the follies of
an ass. When a true man, after gathering his
harvest, sees his product taken by another, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
mounts his horse, before planting again, and with
pitchfork, shotgun or other efficient weapon,
starts in hot pursuit. He seeks to recover last
year's product before trying to raise another crop.</p>

<p>Therefore, when government-made millionaires
try to persuade the working people, small tax-payers
and business men to stop meddling with
politics and instead to work harder in the hope of
laying by something for old age, they really desire
them to cease defending their property and to
continue creating more for others to enjoy.</p>

<p>The learned professor teaches that "the government
cannot legislate into being a single dollar,
nor a dollar's worth of wealth." From this premise,
he reasons that a dollar legislated into one
man's pocket must necessarily be legislated out of
another man's pocket. He then concludes that
the poor cannot legislate themselves comfortable
without to the extent of their gain depriving another
class of their earnings.</p>

<p>If my neighbor accompanied me to market with
a load of potatoes and I were to ask a policeman
to help me take his load from him, the economists'
words would apply. The government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
through its agent, the policeman, could not
double my wealth without robbing my neighbor.
But this is not the situation. I came alone. A
stranger assaulted me and took both wagon and
potatoes, leaving me very poor. Now, in spite
of the professor's words, the state, in the person of
its officer, can abolish my poverty and give me a
wagon filled with potatoes without doing injustice
to any one else. I can be made happy
without depriving any other being of what he has
earned, and I do not ask the state to legislate into
existence a single potato. I simply ask that the
potatoes already existing as the result of my
labor be taken from the highwayman and returned
to their rightful owner.</p>

<p>This is what the masses ask. Not that the government
give them anything produced by others,
not that the government attempt to create anything
independent of the labor of its citizens, but
that it return to them their own. We demand the
capture of the highwayman, monopoly, and that
the opportunities taken from us by him be restored
to us.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
We not only demand but we are actually organizing
for the pursuit. The Democratic Volunteers
are superintending the preliminaries and in
1900 law and order are to be established, the adventurers
suppressed, and restoration made. The
issuance of the nation's money, now a private
monopoly, controlled by bankers, will again be
made a function of government, and the people
will be permitted to exchange their products without
paying revenue to their enemies for the means
of exchange, which is their own creation. Other
wrongs will be righted with equal facility.</p>

<p>Each victim, however, must be taught that his
vote is both horse and hound for pursuing, and
both gun and rope for punishing and reclaiming.
Our vote is our one weapon, our one means of
defense, and source of power.</p>

<p>The value of legislative control to our enemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
is shown by the desperation with which they
oppose any effort on the part of the people to recover
it. They know it to be the true creator
of their fortunes, and they look to it alone for
future "fruits of labor" and "rewards of genius."</p>

<p>We are rich, but we have been ousted from our
patrimony. How shall we recover it? By the
same means through which we lost it, namely,
legislation. The oppressions that curse man are
all entrenched in, and owe their power to, legislation.
If we are to be freed from them, it will be
by legislation. In primitive times, government
was openly, frankly exercised for the enrichment
of a class at the expense of the mass. For ages
the "right divine" was believed in honestly.
Later when its justice was denied, its benefits were
seen to be too valuable to be relinquished. So
duplicity was employed, and the art of "plucking
the goose without making it squeal" was invented.</p>

<p>Money-making heretofore has not been so
much a function of government as money-taking,
and this function can be made to work one way as
well as another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
If thieves by government action can despoil
honest men, honest men by government action
can despoil thieves.</p>

<p>If legislation has been made the instrument of
crime, it also can be made the instrument of restoration.
No personal temperance, thrift and industry
can enrich men so long as the power to
legislate rests in other hands. Labor makes wealth
but legislation decrees how it shall be divided.
When the people legislate directly and intelligently
the division will be in accord with justice. By the
ballot we can enter upon our inheritance.</p>

<p>Poverty exists and we are told that it is the
natural order, with which legislation has nothing
to do. There has been told no more transparent
lie. Wealth is created by the union of man's
labor with nature's gifts. What is it but legislation
that keeps apart in unnatural divorce these
two that God hath joined together? What but
legislation can remove the barriers and allow
them again to come together?</p>

<p>Legislation CAN make money; so lavishly that
no man need want. How? By making conditions
favorable to labor, and securing the
laborer in the fruit of his toil.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>


<h3>WE CAN ACTUALLY VOTE RICHES INTO EXISTENCE.</h3>

<p>Our instructors say, "Government cannot
legislate a single dollar into existence." Let us
see.</p>

<p>While riding to market with a crop of potatoes,
I am dispossessed. In the struggle a portion of
the crop is injured. The highwayman, in escaping,
lames the horses by overdriving. Instead of
going to work the next day, in company with an
officer, I start in pursuit. The robber, alert, removes
to another state at an expense of half his
booty. Whether successful or not, my time, the
officer's time and the thief's time are all wasted,
in addition to three-fourths of my product.</p>

<p>Now, my neighbors and I, who together make
up the government, suppress brigandage. Instead
of three fourths of my crop being wasted by
struggle for possession, it is all sold the very day
it is carted to market. Instead of exchanging my
hoe for a gun and chasing another man, I plant
another crop of potatoes. Instead of helping me
in the chase the policeman grows a crop of his
own, and the bandit, knowing beforehand that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
is impossible to live by robbery, ceases to watch
for possible victims and raises his own potatoes
instead of taking mine.</p>

<p>Without proper governmental interference the
three of us have only a portion of one crop of potatoes
between us. AS THE RESULT OF
GOVERNMENTAL ACTION, WE HAVE
THREE FULL CROPS. THE GOVERNMENT,
BY LEGISLATIVE "EDICT" OR
"FIAT," if you please, CREATES TWO AND
THREE-QUARTERS CROPS OF POTATOES.
WE CAN VOTE OURSELVES
RICH.</p>

<p>And of each dollar voted into our pockets, not
more than fifteen cents will be stolen property reclaimed.
The other eighty-five cents will be a
new product, rescued from waste or destruction.</p>

<p>The saddest feature of our present industrial
cannibalism is that where one dollar is stolen at
least seven dollars are wasted. THE PREVENTABLE
WASTES OF CIVILIZATION
CAN MAKE EARTH A PARADISE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>


<h3>PROSPERITY, "THE McKINLEY" AND OTHER BRANDS.</h3>

<p>We can vote our country prosperous. But it is
very essential that we understand clearly WHOM
we mean when we say "country." We have
been voting for one kind of prosperity for a long
time, even before the "McKinley brand," was on
the market. Our mistake has been in not asking
the "Advance Agents" to tell us whose prosperity
they represented.</p>

<p>If a burglar is emptying your wife's jewelry
box, and filling his trousers pockets with the contents
of your safe, prosperity to him means ruin
to you, and your success means the burglar's
death. So, in the larger affairs of our nation, the
kind of prosperity hoped for by the plunderers of
the people means ruin to their millions of victims,
while good times for the workers, the farmers, the
merchants, mean hard times to our despoilers.</p>

<p>We now have the best times the world has ever
seen. Mr. Rockefeller, or Robafellow&mdash;one is
his name, the other ought to be&mdash;has an income
of forty thousand dollars a day, and it is increasing.
No country in the world has ever produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
so much; never were there barns so bursting with
grain, or warehouses so filled with clothing, furniture
and jewels; never before so many men
making from five to forty thousand dollars a day.</p>

<p>This great National Joint Stock Company of
ours, with its seventy million stockholders, is doing
a thriving business and making barrels of
money. There is only one objectionable feature.
It is that after the labor of these seventy millions
of people, their genius, their suffering and their
sweat, are converted into wealth, the dividends are
given to a few hundred men, while the rest of us
pay the assessments.</p>

<p>We do not need better times. Anybody who
wants to make more than forty thousand dollars
a day is a hog. The real issue is not whether
we shall have hard times or good times, prosperity
or panic in the abstract, but it is whether that
prosperity and good times, now monopolized by
the few, shall become the inheritance of every
child of God.</p>


<h3>THIEVES TAKE PANIC WHEN PURSUED BY HONEST MEN.</h3>

<p>If a select company of burglars and safe-blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>ers
were to enter your village and relieve a number
of your merchants of the contents of their safes,
their stocks of jewels, silks and clothing, and were
to secure all of the finest horses from half the
neighboring farms, and utilize them in getting
the booty safely to the nearest forest, they would
no doubt, while unpacking their wealth and feeding
their horses, after their hasty trip, congratulate
one another upon "their remarkable prosperity."
They would be very apt to brag about the unusual
"good times." But if, as the sun rose over
the tree-tops and they were repacking their goods
they saw suddenly the glistening pitchforks of half
a hundred angry farmers and the determined furious
faces of as many brawny workmen and merchants,
bent on reclaiming their property&mdash;there
would be a PANIC.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The plunderers of the world are enjoying good
times at the expense of the masses. Their profits
are as fabulous as their methods are cruel. But in
the midst of their celebration feast, their crime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
is discovered, and the pitchforks of five million
farmers glistening in the morning sun, the angry
faces of four million city workmen loom up in the
distance, and the result is PANIC and loss of
confidence&mdash;(among the revelers.)</p>

<p>As we approach November, 1900, this panic
will increase. But as there wells up the sound infernal
of their weeping and wailing and gnashing
of teeth, there will be heard still louder, the voices
of millions singing their chorus of deliverance.
As these offenders look into the grave where lies
buried their every plan for selfish aggrandizement,
to us, their innumerable victims, that same
grave will be the open window through which we
behold the land of promise.</p>
